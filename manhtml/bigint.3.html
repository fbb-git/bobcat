<p>
<h2>NAME</h2>FBB::BigInt - Arithmetic on Integers of Unlimited Size
<p>
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
    <strong>#include &lt;bobcat/bigint&gt;</strong><br>
    Linking option: <em>-lbobcat -lcrypto</em> 
<p>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
This class is defined as a wrapper class around the <em>openSSL</em> <em>BN</em> series
of functions, offering members to perform arithmetic on integral values of
unlimited sizes. Members are offered to generate primes and to perform all
kinds of common arithmetic operations on <em>BigInt</em> objects. Also, conversions
to characters and standard numerical value types are offered.
<p>
Below, the phrase <em>the object</em> may also refer to the object's value. The
context in which this occurs will make clear that the object's value rather
than the object as-is is referred to.
<p>
Various constructors accept <em>BIGNUM</em> arguments. Type <em>BIGNUM</em> is the type
containing an integer of unlimited precision as defined by OpenSSL.
<p>
Signs of <em>BigInt</em> are handled in a special way. Whether a <em>BigInt</em> is
negative or positive is determined by its sign-flag, and not by a sign bit as
is the case with <em>int</em> typed values. Since <em>BigInt</em> values have unlimited
precision shifting values to the left won't change their signs.
<p>
Operators return either a reference to the current (modified) object or return
a <em>BigInt</em> object containing the computed value. The rule followed here was
to implement the operators analogously to the way the operators work on
<em>int</em> type values and variables. E.g., <em>operator+()</em> returns a <em>BigInt</em>
value whereas <em>operator+=()</em> returns a <em>BigInt &amp;</em> reference.
<p>
All members modifying their objects return a reference to the current
(modified) object. All members not modifying the current object return a
<em>BigInt</em> object. If both members exists performing the same
functionality the name of the member returning a <em>BigInt</em> object ends
in a <em>c</em> (const) (e.g., <em>addMod</em> and <em>addModc</em>).
<p>
Almost all operators, members and constructors (except for the default
constructor) throw <em>Exception</em> exceptions on failure.
<p>
<h2>INHERITS FROM</h2>
    -
<p>
<h2>TYPE</h2>
<p>
The class <strong>BigInt</strong> defines the type <em>Word</em>, which is equal to the type
<em>BN_ULONG</em> used by <em>OpenSSL</em> to store integral values of unlimited
precision. A <em>Word</em> is an <em>unsigned long</em>, which is, depending on the
architecture, usually 64 or 32 bits long. 
<p>
<h2>ENUMERATIONS</h2>
    <strong>Msb</strong><br>
    This (most significant bit) enumeration is used when generating a
        cryptographically strong random number. Its values are:
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>MSB_UNKNOWN</strong>:<br>
       The most significant bit may be 0 or 1.
    <li> <strong>MSB_IS_ONE</strong>:<br>
        The most significant bit is guaranteed to be 1.
    <li> <strong>TOP_TWO_BITS_ONE</strong>:<br>
        The two most significant bits are guaranteed to be 1, resulting in a
        product of two values each containing <em>nBits</em> having <em>2 * nBits</em>
        bits.
    </ul>
<p>
<strong>Lsb</strong><br>
    This (least significant bit) enumeration is used when generating random
        numbers, ensuring that the resulting value is either odd or even.
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>EVEN</strong>:<br>
        The random value will be an even value;
    <li> <strong>ODD</strong>:<br>
        The random value will be an odd value.
    </ul>
<p>
<h2>CONSTRUCTORS</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>BigInt()</strong>:<br>
        The default constructor initializes a <em>BigInt</em> value to 0.
    <li> <strong>explicit BigInt(BIGNUM const &amp;value)</strong>:<br>
        This constructor initializes a <em>BigInt</em> from a <em>const BIGNUM</em>. 
    <li> <strong>explicit BigInt(BIGNUM const *value)</strong>:<br>
        This constructor initializes a <em>BigInt</em> from a pointer to a 
        <em>const BIGNUM</em>.
    <li> <strong>BigInt(Type value)</strong>:<br>
        This constructor is defined as a member template. Any type that can be
converted using a static cast to an <em>unsigned long</em> can be used as argument
to this constructor. Promotion is allowed, so in many situations where
<em>BigInt</em>s are expected a plain numerical value can be used as well.
    <li> <strong>BigInt(char const *bigEndian, size_t length, bool negative = false)</strong>:<br>
        This constructor initializes a <em>BigInt</em> from <em>length</em>
big-endian encoded bytes stored in <em>bigEndian</em>. This constructor interprets
the <em>char</em> values pointed at by <em>bigEndian</em> as unsigned values. Use this
constructor to reconstruct a <em>BigInt</em> object from the data made available by
the <em>bigEndian</em> member. If the number represents a negative value, then
provide a third argument <em>true</em>.
    <li> <strong>explicit BigInt(std::string const &amp;bigEndian, bool negative = false)</strong>:<br>
        This constructor initializes a <em>BigInt</em> from the bytes stored in
<em>bigEndian</em>, which must be big-endian encoded. This constructor interprets
the <em>char</em> values stored in <em>bigEndian</em> as unsigned values. If the number
that is stored in <em>bigEndian</em> represents a negative value, then provide a
second argument <em>true</em>.
    </ul>
<p>
The standard copy constructor is available, the move constructor is not
available. 
<p>
<h2>MEMBER FUNCTIONS</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>BigInt &amp;addMod(BigInt const &amp;rhs, BigInt const &amp;mod) </strong>:<br>
       <em>Rhs</em> is added (modulo <em>mod</em>) to the current object.
<p>
<li> <strong>BigInt addModc(BigInt const &amp;rhs, BigInt const &amp;mod) </strong>:<br>
       The sum (modulo <em>mod</em>) of the current object and <em>rhs</em> is returned.
<p>
<li> <strong>BigInt::Word at(size_t index) const</strong>:<br>
       Returns the <em>Word</em> at <em>index</em>. E.g., on a 32 bit architecture, if
        the <strong>BigInt</strong> value equals 2<sup>33</sup>, then <em>at(0)</em> returns 0, and
        <em>at(1)</em> returns 2. If <em>index</em> equals or exceeds the value returned
        by <em>nWords</em> an <em>FBB::Exception</em> is thrown.
<p>
<li> <strong>BIGNUM const &amp;bignum() const</strong>:<br>
       A reference to the <em>BIGNUM</em> value maintained by the current
        <em>BigInt</em> object is returned.
<p>
<li> <strong>char *bigEndian() const</strong>:<br> The value represented by the current object
        is stored in a series of <em>char</em> typed values in big-endian order. If
        a value consists of 5 <em>char</em>s the eight most significant bits will
        be stored in the <em>char</em> having index value 0, the eight least
        significant bits will be stored in the <em>char</em> having index value
        4. When needed simply swap <em>char[i]</em> with <em>char[j]</em> (i = 0
        .. nBytes/2, j = nBytes-1 .. nBytes/2) to convert to little-endian
        order. The return value consists of a series of <em>sizeInBytes()</em> (see
        below) dynamically allocated <em>char</em> values. The caller of
        <em>bigEndian</em> owns the allocated memory and should eventually delete
        it again using <em>delete[]</em>. Note that the current object's <em>sign</em>
        cannot be inferred from the return value.
<p>
<li> <strong>BigInt &amp;clearBit(size_t index)</strong>:<br>
       The current object's bit at index position <em>index</em> is cleared.
<p>
<li> <strong>BigInt clearBit(size_t index) const</strong>:<br>
       A copy of the current object having its bit at index position
        <em>index</em> cleared.
<p>
<li> <strong>long long diophantus(long long *factor1, long long *factor2,

       The integral solution of <em>factor1 * value1 + factor2 * value2 = gcd</em>
        is computed. The function returns the greatest common divisor
        (<em>gcd</em>) of <em>value1</em> and <em>value2</em>, and returns their
        multiplication factors in, respectively, <em>*factor1</em> and
        <em>*factor2</em>. The solution is not unique: another solution is obtained
        by adding <em>k * value2</em> to <em>factor1</em> and subtracting <em>k * value1</em>
        from <em>factor2</em>. For values exceeding <em>std::numeric_limits&lt;long,
        long&gt;::max()</em> the next member can be used.
<p>
<li> <strong>BigInt diophantus(BigInt *factor1, BigInt *factor2, 
                            BigInt const &amp;value1, BigInt const &amp;value2)</strong>:<br>
       The integral solution of <em>factor1 * value1 + factor2 * value2 = gcd</em>
        is computed. The function returns the greatest common divisor
        (<em>gcd</em>) of <em>value1</em> and <em>value2</em>, and returns their
        multiplication factors in, respectively, <em>*factor1</em> and
        <em>*factor2</em>. The solution is not unique: another solution is obtained
        by adding <em>k * value2</em> to <em>factor1</em> and subtracting <em>k * value1</em>
        from <em>factor2</em>.

<li> <strong>int compare(BigInt const &amp;rsh) const</strong>:<br>
       Using signed values, if the current object is smaller than <em>rhs</em> -1
        is returned; if they are equal 0 is returned; if the current object is

<li> <strong>BigInt &amp;gcd(BigInt const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br>
       The greatest common divisor (gcd) of the current object and <em>rhs</em> is
        assigned to the current object. To compute the least common multiple
        (lcm) the following relationship can be used:

<p>
<li> <strong>BigInt &amp;inverseMod(BigInt const &amp;mod)</strong>:<br>
       The inverse of the current object modulo <em>mod</em> is assigned to the
        current object. This is the value <em>ret</em> for which the following

       <strong>BigInt</strong> values are stored in units of `words', which are unsigned
        long values. These values may consist of, e.g., 32 or 64 bits. The

       All the bits in
        the bytes of the current object and the sign of the current object
        are toggled.
       So, after
            <pre>

        Bigint b(5);
        b.tildeBits();
            
</pre>

       <em>b</em> contains the value -250. Also see the discussion with

<p>
<li> <strong>BigInt tildeIntc() const</strong>:<br>
       A copy of the current object is returned to which the `tilde' operation

<p>
<li> <strong>unsigned long ulong() const</strong>:<br> 
       The absolute value stored in the current object is returned as an
        unsigned long. If it cannot be represented by an unsigned long it
        returns <em>0xffffffffL</em>.
<p>
<li> <strong>int uCompare(BigInt const &amp;rsh) const</strong>:<br>
       Using absolute values, if the current object is smaller than <em>rhs</em> -1
        is returned; if they are equal 0 is returned; if the current object is
        larger than <em>ths</em> 1 is returned (see also <em>uCompare</em>).
    </ul>
<p>
<h2>OVERLOADED OPERATORS</h2>
<p>
Except for some operators all operators perform their intuitive
operations. Where that isn't completely true an explanatory remark is
provided. E.g., <em>operator*()</em> multiplies two <em>BigInt</em>s, possibly promoting
one of the operands; <em>operator*=()</em> multiplies the lhs by the rhs
<em>BigInt</em>, possibly promoting the rhs operand.
<p>
Here are the available operators:

    <li> <strong>bool operator bool() const</strong>:<br>
       Returns <em>true</em> if the <em>BigInt</em> value is unequal zero, otherwise
        <em>false</em> is returned.
<p>
<li> <strong>BigInt &amp;operator++()</strong>:<br>
    <li> <strong>BigInt operator++(int)</strong>:<br>
    <li> <strong>BigInt &amp;operator--()</strong>:<br>
    <li> <strong>BigInt operator--(int)</strong>:<br>
    <li> <strong>BigInt operator-()</strong>:<br>
    <li> <strong>int operator[](size_t idx) const</strong>:<br>
       With <em>BigInt</em> objects it returns the bit-value of the object's
        <em>idx</em>th bit as the value 0 or 1.
<p>
<li> <strong>BigInt::Bit operator[](size_t idx)</strong>:<br>
       With non-const <em>BigInt</em> objects it returns a reference to the
        bit-value of the object's <em>idx</em>th bit. When used as <em>lvalue</em>
        assigning a 0 or non-zero value to the operator's return value will
        either clear or set the bit.  Likewise, the following arithmetic
        assignment operators may be used: binary or (<em>|=</em>), binary and
        (<em>&amp;=</em>) or binary xor (<em>^=</em>). When used as <em>rvalue</em> the value of
        the object's <em>idx</em>th bit is returned as a <em>bool</em> value. When
        inseerted into a <em>std::ostream</em> the bit's value is displayed as 0 or
        1. 
<p>
<li> <strong>BigInt operator~()</strong>:<br>
       This operator is <em>not</em> implemented as it cannot be implemented so
        that it matches the actions of this operator when applied to <em>int</em>
        type values.
<p>
When used on <em>int</em> values this operator toggles all the <em>int</em>'s
        bits. E.g., ~5 represents -6, and ~-6 again equals five. The -6 is the
        result of the sign bit of <em>int</em> values. The obvious implementation
        of <em>BigInt::operator~()</em> is to toggle all the value's bits and to
        toggle its sign bit. For 5 this would result in -250: 5, being 101
        (binary), fits in one byte, so ~5 becomes 11111010 (binary), which is
        250. Its sign must be reversed as well, so it becomes -250.  This
        clearly differs from the value represented by the <em>int</em> constant ~5:
        when constructing <em>BigInt(~5)</em>, the value -6 is obtained.
<p>
It is possible to change the implementation. E.g., after
            <pre>

        Bigint b(5);
        b = ~b;
            
</pre>

       <em>~b</em> could be implemented so that it results in the value -6. But
        this too leads to unexpected results. While <em>5 &amp; ~5 == 0</em>, this
        would no longer hold true for <em>BigInt</em> objects: Assuming <em>b</em>
        contains 5 then <em>b &amp; ~b</em> would expand to (binary) <em>101 &amp;
        (negative)110</em> which equals (binary) 100.
<p>
Since either implementation produces unexpected results
        <em>BigInt::operator~()</em> was not implemented. Instead two members are
        offered: <em>tildeBits()</em>, toggling all the bits of all the
       <em>BigInt</em> bytes and toggling its sign (so
            <pre>

        Bigint b(5);
        b.tildeBits();
            
</pre>

       changes <em>b</em>'s value into -250), and <em>tildeInt()</em> changing the
        object's value into the value that would have been obtained if a
       <em>BigInt</em> was a mere <em>int</em> (so    
        <pre>

        Bigint b(5);
        b.tildeInt();
            
</pre>

       changes <em>b</em>'s value into -6).
    </ul>
<p>
<strong>Binary operators:</strong>
<p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>BigInt operator*(BigInt const &amp;lhs, BigInt const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br>
    <li> <strong>BigInt operator/(BigInt const &amp;lhs, BigInt const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br>
       This operator returns the quotient of the <em>lhs</em> object divided by the
        <em>rhs</em> object. The remainder is lost (The member <em>div</em> performs the
        division and makes the remainder available as well).
    <li> <strong>BigInt operator%(BigInt const &amp;lhs, BigInt const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br>
    <li> <strong>BigInt operator+(BigInt const &amp;lhs, BigInt const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br>
    <li> <strong>BigInt operator-(BigInt const &amp;lhs, BigInt const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br> 
    <li> <strong>BigInt operator&lt;&lt;(BigInt const &amp;lhs, size_t nBits)</strong>:<br>
        See also the <em>lshift</em> members. If <em>lhs</em> is positive, 
    <li> <strong>BigInt operator&gt;&gt;=(BigInt const &amp;lhs, size_t nBits)</strong>:<br>
       See also the <em>rshift</em> members.
    <li> <strong>BigInt operator&amp;(BigInt const &amp;lhs, BigInt const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br> 
        This operator returns a <em>BigInt</em> value consisting of the
        <em>bit_and</em>-ed bits and sign flags of lhs and rhs
        operands. Consequently, if one operand is positive, the resulting
        value will be positive. 
    <li> <strong>BigInt operator|(BigInt const &amp;lhs, BigInt const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br> 
        This operator returns a <em>BigInt</em> value consisting of the
        <em>bit_or</em>-ed bits and sign flags of lhs and rhs
        operands. Consequently, if either operand is negative, the result will
        be negative. 
    <li> <strong>BigInt operator^(BigInt const &amp;lhs, BigInt const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br> 
        This operator returns a <em>BigInt</em> value consisting of the
        <em>bit_xor</em>-ed bits and sign flags of lhs and rhs
        operands. Consequently, if exactly one operand is negative, the result
        will be negative. 
    </ul>
<p>
<strong>(Arithmetic) assignment operator(s):</strong>
<p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>BigInt &amp;operator=(BigInt const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br>
    <li> <strong>BigInt &amp;operator*=(BigInt const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br>
    <li> <strong>BigInt &amp;operator/=(BigInt const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br>
       This operator assigns the result of the (integer) division of the current
        <em>BigInt</em> object by <em>ths</em> to the current object. The remainder is
        lost. The member <em>div</em> divides and makes the remainder available as
        well.
    <li> <strong>BigInt &amp;operator%=(BigInt const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br>
    <li> <strong>BigInt &amp;operator+=(BigInt const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br>
    <li> <strong>BigInt &amp;operator-=(BigInt const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br>
    <li> <strong>BigInt &amp;operator&lt;&lt;=(size_t nBits)</strong>:<br>
        See also the <em>lshift</em> members.
    <li> <strong>BigInt &amp;operator&gt;&gt;=(size_t nBits)</strong>:<br>
        See also the <em>rshift</em> members.
    <li> <strong>BigInt &amp;operator&amp;=(BigInt const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br> 
        This operator <em>bit_and</em>s the bits and sign flags of the current
        object and the rhs operand.
    <li> <strong>BigInt &amp;operator|=(BigInt const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br> 
        This operator <em>bit_or</em>s the bits and sign flags of the current
        object and the rhs operand.
    <li> <strong>BigInt &amp;operator^=(BigInt const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br> 
        This operator <em>bit_xor</em>s the bits and sign flags of the current
        object and the rhs operand.
    </ul>
<p>
Note that the move operator is not available
<p>
<h2>STATIC MEMBERS</h2>
<p>
All members returning a <em>BigInt</em> computed from a set of arguments and
not requiring an existing <em>BigInt</em> object are defined as static members.
<p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>BigInt fromText(std::string text, int mode = 0)</strong>:<br>
       This member converts a textual representation of a number to a
        <em>BigInt</em> value. Conversion continues until the end of <em>text</em> or
        until a character outside of an expected range is encountered.  
<p>
The expected range may be preset by specifying <em>mode</em> as <em>ios::dec,
        ios::oct,</em> or <em>ios::hex</em> or (the default) the expected range is
        determined by <em>fromText</em> itself by inspecting the characters in
        <em>text</em>.
<p>
By default if <em>text</em> contains hexadecimal characters then
        <em>fromText</em> assumes that the number is represented as a hexadecimal
        value (e.g., <em>"abc"</em> is converted to the (decimal) value 2748); if
        <em>text</em> starts with 0 and contains only characters in the range 0
        until (including) 7 then <em>fromText</em> assumes the number is
        represented as an octal value (e.g., <em>"01234"</em> is converted to the
        (decimal) value 668). Otherwise a decimal value is assumed. 
<p>
If the text does not represent a valid numerical value (of the
        given extraction mode) then a <em>FBB::Exception</em> exception is thrown
        (<em>fromText: text does not represent a BigInt value</em>).
<p>
<li> <strong>BigInt rand(size_t size, Msb msb = MSB_IS_ONE, Lsb lsb = ODD)</strong>:<br>
       This member returns a cryptographically strong pseudo-random number
        of <em>size</em> bits. The most significant bit(s) can be controlled by
        <em>msb</em> (by default <strong>MSB_IS_ONE</strong>), the least significant bit can be
        controlled by <em>lsb</em> (by default <strong>ODD</strong>). Before calling this
        member the random number generator must have been seeded.
<p>
From the <strong>RAND_add</strong>(3ssl) man-page:
<p>
OpenSSL makes sure that the PRNG state is unique for each thread. On
        systems that provide <em>/dev/urandom</em>, the randomness device is used
        to seed the PRNG transparently. However, on all other systems, the
        application is responsible for seeding the PRNG by calling
        <strong>RAND_add</strong>(3ssl), <strong>RAND_egd</strong>(3ssl), <strong>RAND_load_file</strong>(3ssl), or
        <strong>RAND_seed</strong>(3ssl).
<p>
<li> <strong>BigInt randRange(BigInt const &amp;max)</strong>:<br>
       This member returns a cryptographically strong pseudo-random
        number in the range <em>0 &lt;= number &lt; max</em>. Before calling this
        member the random number generator must have been seeded (see also
        <strong>rand</strong>, described above).
<p>
<li> <strong>BigInt setBigEndian(std::string const &amp;bytes)</strong>:<br> 
       The <em>bytes.length()</em> bytes of <em>bytes</em> are used to compute a
        <em>BigInt</em> object which is returned by this function. The characters
        in <em>bytes</em> are interpreted as a series of bytes in big-endian
        order. See also the member function <em>bigEndian()</em> above. The
        returned <em>BigInt</em> has a positive value.
<p>
<li> <strong>BigInt prime(size_t nBits, 
                            BigInt const *mod = 0, BigInt const *rem = 0,
                            PrimeType primeType = ANY)</strong>:<br>
       This member returns a prime number of <em>bBits</em> bits. If both <em>mod</em>
        and <em>rem</em> are non-zero, the condition prime % mod == rem.
        (E.g., use <em>prime % mod == 1</em> in order to suit a given
        generator). The parameter <em>primeType</em> can be <em>ANY</em>, <em>(prime - 1)
        / 2</em> may or may not be a prime. If it is <em>SAFE</em> then  <em>(prime - 1)
        / 2</em> will be a (so-called <em>safe</em>) prime.
<p>
<li> <strong>BigInt pseudoRand(size_t size, Msb msb = MSB_IS_ONE, Lsb lsb =
            ODD)</strong>:<br> 
       This member returns a potentially predictable pseudo-random number of
        <em>size</em> bits. The most significant bit(s) can be controlled by
        <em>msb</em> (by default <strong>MSB_IS_ONE</strong>), the least significant bit can be
        controlled by <em>lsb</em> (by default <strong>ODD</strong>). It can be used for
        non-cryptographic purposes and for certain purposes in cryptographic
        protocols, but usually not for key generation.
<p>
<li> <strong>BigInt pseudoRandRange(BigInt const &amp;max)</strong>:<br>
       This member returns a potentially predictable  pseudo-random
       number in the range <em>0 &lt;= number &lt; max</em>.
    </ul>
<p>
<h2>FREE FUNCTIONS IN THE FBB NAMESPACE</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>std::ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(ostream &amp;out, BigInt const &amp;value)</strong>:<br>
        Inserts <em>value</em> into the provided <em>ostream</em>. If the <em>hex</em>
manipulator has been inserted into the stream before inserting the <em>BigInt</em>
value the value will be displayed as a hexadecimal value (without a leading
<em>0x</em>); if the <em>oct</em> manipulator has been inserted the value will be
represented as an octal value (starting with a 0). The value will be
displayed as a decimal value if the <em>dec</em> manipulator is active. If the
<em>BigInt</em> value is negative its value will be preceded by a minus
character. 
    <li> <strong>std::istream &amp;operator&gt;&gt;(istream &amp;in, BigInt &amp;value)</strong>:<br>
       Extracts <em>value</em> from the provided <em>istream</em>. Depending on the
        currently set extraction mode (<em>dec, oct,</em> or <em>hex</em>) the matching
        set of characters will be extracted from <em>in</em> and converted to a
        number which is stored in <em>value</em>. Extraction stops at EOF or at the
        first character outside of the range of characters matching the
        extraction mode. if no numerical characters were extracted the
        stream's <em>failbit</em> is set. The extracted value may be preceded
        by a minus character, resulting in an extracted negative value.
    </ul>

<h2>BUGS</h2>
<p>
Sep/Oct 2013: due to a change in library handling by the linker
(cf. <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/UnderstandingDSOLinkChange">http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/UnderstandingDSOLinkChange</a> and
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ToolChain/DSOLinking">https://wiki.debian.org/ToolChain/DSOLinking</a>) libraries that are
indirectly required are no longer automatically linked to your program. With
<strong>BigInt</strong> this is <em>libcrypto</em>, which requires programs to link to both
<em>bobcat</em> and <em>crypto</em>.
