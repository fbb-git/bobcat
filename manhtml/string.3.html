<p>
<h2 >NAME</h2>FBB::String - Several operations on <strong >std::string</strong> objects
<p>
<h2 >SYNOPSIS</h2>
    <strong >#include &lt;bobcat/string&gt;</strong><br/>
    Linking option: <em >-lbobcat</em> 
<p>
<h2 >DESCRIPTION</h2>
    This class offers facilities for often used transformations on
<em >std::string</em> objects, but which are not supported by the <em >std::string</em>
class itself. All members of <strong >FBB::String</strong> are static.
<p>
<h2 >NAMESPACE</h2>
    <strong >FBB</strong><br/>
    All members, operators and manipulators, mentioned in this man-page, are
defined in the namespace <strong >FBB</strong>.
<p>
<h2 >INHERITS FROM</h2>
    --
<p>
<h2 >ENUMERATION</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >Type</strong>:<br/>
        This enumeration indicates the nature of the contents of an element in
the array returned by the overloaded <em >split</em> members (see below).
<p>
<strong >DQUOTE</strong>, a subset of the characters in the matching <em >string</em>
element was delimited by double quotes in the in the string that was parsed by
the <em >split</em> members.
<p>
<strong >DQUOTE_UNTERMINATED</strong>, the contents of the string that was
parsed by the <em >split</em> members started at some point with a double quote, but
the matching ending double quote was lacking.
<p>
<strong >ESCAPED_END</strong>,  the contents of the string that was
parsed by the <em >split</em> members ended in a mere backslash.
<p>
<strong >NORMAL</strong>, a normal string; 
<p>
<strong >SEPARATOR</strong>, a separator;
<p>
<strong >SQUOTE</strong>, a subset of the characters in the matching <em >string</em>
element was delimited by quotes in the in the string that was parsed by
the <em >split</em> members.
<p>
<strong >SQUOTE_UNTERMINATED</strong>, the contents of the string that was
parsed by the <em >split</em> members started at some point with a quote, but
the matching ending quote was lacking.
    </ul>
<p>
<h2 >TYPEDEF</h2>
<p>
The <strong >typedef SplitPair</strong> represents <strong >std::pair&lt;std::string,
String::Type&gt;</strong> and is used in the second variant of the <strong >split</strong> member (see
below).
<p>
<h2 >HISTORY</h2>
    Initially this class was derived from <strong >std::string</strong>. Deriving from
<em >std::string</em>, however, is considerd bad design as <em >std::string</em> was
not designed as a base-class. 
<p>
<strong >FBB::String</strong> offers a series of <em >static</em> member functions
providing the facilities originally implemented as non-static members.
<p>
<h2 >STATIC MEMBER FUNCTIONS</h2>
    <ul>
<p>
<li> <strong >char const **argv(std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; const &amp;words)</strong>:<br/>
        Returns a pointer to an allocated series of pointers to the <strong >C</strong>
strings stored in the vector <em >words</em>. The caller is responsible for
returning the array of pointers to the common pool, but should <em >not</em> delete
the <strong >C</strong>-strings to which the pointers point. The last element of the
returned array is guaranteed to be a 0-pointer. 
<p>
<li> <strong >int casecmp(std::string const &amp;lhs, std::string const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br/>
        Performs a case-insensitive comparison between the two <em >std::string</em>
objects. A negative value is returned if <em >lhs</em> should be ordered before
<em >rhs</em>; 0 is returned if the two strings have identical contents; a
positive value is returned if the <em >lhs</em> object should be ordered beyond
<em >rhs</em>.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::string escape(std::string const &amp;str, 
            char const *series = "'\"\\")</strong>:<br/>
        Returns a copy of the <em >str</em> object in which all characters in
<em >series</em> are prefixed by a backslash character.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::string lc(std::string const &amp;str) const</strong>:<br/>
        Returns a copy of the <em >str</em> object in which all letters were
transformed to lower case letters.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::string trim(std::string const &amp;str)</strong>:<br/>
        Returns a copy of the <em >str</em> object from which the leading and
trailing blanks have been removed.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; split(Type *type, std::string const
                &amp;str, char const *separators = " \t", bool addEmpty = false)</strong>:<br/>
        Returns a vector containing the elements in <em >str</em> which are
separated from each other by at least one of the characters found in
<em >*separators</em>. The member's first parameter points to a <em >Type</em> variable,
which will show <em >DQUOTE_UNTERMINATED, SQUOTE_UNTERMINATED,</em> or
<em >ESCAPED_END</em> in cases where the contents of <em >str</em> are ill-formed, or
<em >NORMAL</em> if <em >str</em>'s contents shows not syntactic errors (i.e., ill-formed
strings or escape-sequences). If the corresponding argument equals 0 then no
<em >Type</em> indication is provided.
<p>
If the parameter <em >addEmpty</em> is set to <em >true</em>, then individual separators
encountered in <em >str</em> are stored as empty strings in <em >words</em> (e.g., if two
elements are separated by three blank spaces, then the returned vector
contains three empty strings between the two elements).
<p>
If an element in <em >str</em> contains a double quote (<em >"</em>), then all characters
from the initial double quote through the matching double quote character are
processed as follows: the surrounding double quotes are removed, and the
remaining characters are <em >unescaped</em> using the <em >String::unescape</em>
member. The resulting unescaped string is added to the element currently under
construction. E.g., if <em >str</em> contains
        <pre>

    string="\"hello world\""
        
</pre>
 
    then the element becomes 
        <pre>

    string="hello world"
        
</pre>

<p>
If an element in <em >str</em> contains a single quote (<em >'</em>), then all characters
between the initial quote and the matching quote character are literally
appended to the element currently under construction. E.g., if <em >str</em>
contains
        <pre>

    string='"hello\ world"'
        
</pre>
 
    then the element becomes 
        <pre>

    string="hello\ world"
        
</pre>

<p>
Backslash characters encountered in <em >str</em> outside of single or double quoted
strings are unescaped (using <em >String::unescape</em>) and the resulting character
is appended to the element currently under construction. 
<p>
E.g., if <em >str</em>
contains
        <pre>

    string=\"hello\ world\"
        
</pre>
 
    then the element becomes 
        <pre>

    string="hello world"
        
</pre>

<p>
<li> <strong >std::vector&lt;SplitPair&gt; split(std::string const &amp;str,
                    char const *separators = " \t", bool addEmpty = false)</strong>:<br/>
        Same functionality as the previous <em >split</em> member, but the <em >words</em>
vector is filled with pairs, of which the first elements represent the
recognized strings, and the second elements are values of the <em >String::Type</em>
enumeration. If <strong >addEmpty</strong> is requested, then the <strong >string</strong> elements
contain the actual contents of the separator, while the <strong >Type</strong> elements are
set to <strong >SEPARATOR</strong>. If the returned vector is not empty then the <em >second</em>
member of the last element may be <em >DQUOTE_UNTERMINATED,
SQUOTE_UNTERMINATED,</em> or <em >ESCAPED_END</em> in cases where the contents of
<em >str</em> are ill-formed.
<p>
<li> <strong >size_t split(std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; *words,
                    std::string const &amp;str,
                    char const *separators = " \t", bool addEmpty = false)</strong>:<br/>
        Fills <em >words</em> with all elements of the <em >str</em> object, separated by
any of the characters in <em >separators</em>. If the parameter <em >addEmpty</em> is set
to <em >true</em>, the individual separators are stored as empty strings in
<em >words</em>. If a word starts with <em >"</em> or <em >'</em> all characters until a
matching terminating <em >"</em> or <em >'</em> at the end of a word are considered as one
word.  The surrounding quotes are not stored. The function returns the number
of elements in the vector pointed to by <em >words</em>. This vector is initially
cleared.
<p>
<li> <strong >size_t  split(std::vector&lt;SplitPair&gt; *words,
                    std::string const &amp;str,
                    char const *separators = " \t", bool addEmpty = false)</strong>:<br/>
        Same functionality as the former member, but the <em >words</em> vector is
filled with pairs, of which the first elements are the recognized strings, and
the second elements values of the <em >String::Type</em> enumeration. If
<strong >addEmpty</strong> is requested, then the <strong >string</strong> elements contain the actual
contents of the separator, while the <strong >Type</strong> elements are set to
<strong >SEPARATOR</strong>.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::string unescape(std::string const &amp;str)</strong>:<br/>
        Returns a copy of the <em >str</em> object in which the escaped (i.e.,
prefixed by a backslash) characters have been interpreted. All standard escape
characters (<em >\a</em>, <em >\b</em>, <em >\f</em>, <em >\n</em>, <em >\r</em>, <em >\t</em>, <em >\v</em>) are
recognized. If an escape character is followed by <em >x</em> the next two
characters are interpreted as a hexadecimal number. If an escape character is
followed by an octal digit, then the next three characters following the
backslash are interpreted as an octal number. In all other cases, the
backslash is removed and the character following the backslash is kept.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::string uc(std::string const &amp;str)</strong>:<br/>
        Returns a copy of the <em >str</em> object in which all letters were
capitalized. 
    </ul>
