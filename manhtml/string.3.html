<p>
<h2 >NAME</h2>FBB::String - Several operations on <strong >std::string</strong> objects
<p>
<h2 >SYNOPSIS</h2>
    <strong >#include &lt;bobcat/string&gt;</strong><br/>
    Linking option: <em >-lbobcat</em> 
<p>
<h2 >DESCRIPTION</h2>
    This class offers facilities for often used transformations on
<em >std::string</em> objects, which are not supported by the <em >std::string</em>
class itself. All members of <strong >FBB::String</strong> are static.
<p>
Initially this class was derived from <strong >std::string</strong>. Deriving from
<em >std::string</em>, however, is considerd bad design as <em >std::string</em> was
not designed as a base-class. 
<p>
<strong >FBB::String</strong> offers a series of <em >static</em> member functions
providing the facilities originally implemented as non-static members. One of
these members is the (overloaded) <em >split</em> member, splitting a string into
elements separated by one or more configurable characters. These elements may
contain or consist of double- or single-quoted (sub) strings and escape
characters. Escape characters are converted to their implied byte-values
(e.g., <em >\n</em> is converted to byte value 10) unless they are embedded in
single-quoted (sub) strings. Quotes surrounding double- and single-quoted
(sub) strings are removed from the elements returned by the <em >split</em>
members. 
<p>
<h2 >NAMESPACE</h2>
    <strong >FBB</strong><br/>
    All constructors, members, operators and manipulators, mentioned in this
man-page, are defined in the namespace <strong >FBB</strong>.

<p>
<h2 >ENUMERATIONS</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >Type</strong>:<br/>
        This enumeration indicates the nature of the contents of an element in
the array returned by the overloaded <em >split</em> members (see below).
<p>
<strong >DQUOTE</strong>, a subset of the characters in the matching <em >string</em>
element was delimited by double quotes in the in the string that was parsed by
the <em >split</em> members.
<p>
<strong >DQUOTE_UNTERMINATED</strong>, the contents of the string that was
parsed by the <em >split</em> members started at some point with a double quote, but
the matching ending double quote was lacking.
<p>
<strong >ESCAPED_END</strong>,  the contents of the string that was
parsed by the <em >split</em> members ended in a mere backslash.
<p>
<strong >NORMAL</strong>, a normal string; 
<p>
<strong >SEPARATOR</strong>, a separator;
<p>
<strong >SQUOTE</strong>, a subset of the characters in the matching <em >string</em>
element was delimited by quotes in the in the string that was parsed by
the <em >split</em> members.
<p>
<strong >SQUOTE_UNTERMINATED</strong>, the contents of the string that was
parsed by the <em >split</em> members started at some point with a quote, but
the matching ending quote was lacking.
    <li> <strong >SplitType</strong>:<br/>
       This enumeration is used to specify how <em >split</em> members should
        split the information in the string objects that are passed to these
        members: 
<p>
<strong >TOK</strong>: the <em >split</em> member acts like the standard <strong >C</strong> function
        <strong >strtok</strong>(3). The essence here is that no empty elements are
        returned. E.g., a string containing <em >"a,,"</em> which is processed using
        the <em >TOK</em> mode returns a <em >NORMAL</em> element containing <em >"a"</em>.
<p>
<strong >TOKSEP</strong>: the <em >split</em> member acts like the standard <strong >C</strong> function
        <strong >strtok</strong>(3), also returning information about encountered
        separators. Since <em >strtok</em> doesn't return empty elements, <em >TOKSEP</em>
        uses empty elements to indicate the occurrence of separators. E.g., a
        string containing <em >"a,,"</em> which is processed using the <em >TOKSEP</em>
        mode returns a <em >NORMAL</em> element containing <em >"a"</em>, followed by two
        empty <em >SEPARATOR</em> elements.
<p>
<strong >STR</strong>: the <em >split</em> member acts like the standard <strong >C</strong> function
        <strong >strstr</strong>(3). The essence here is that empty elements are also
        returned. E.g., a string containing <em >"a,,"</em> which is processed using
        the <em >STR</em> mode returns an element containing <em >"a"</em>, followed by
        two empty <em >NORMAL</em> elements.
<p>
<strong >STRSEP</strong>: the <em >split</em> member acts like the standard <strong >C</strong> function
        <strong >strstr</strong>(3), also returning information about encountered
        separators.  E.g., a string containing <em >"a,,"</em> which is processed
        using the <em >STRSEP</em> mode returns a <em >NORMAL</em> element containing
        <em >"a"</em>, followed by a <em >SEPARATOR</em> element containing <em >","</em>,
        followed by a <em >NORMAL</em> empty element, followed by a <em >SEPARATOR</em>
        element containing <em >","</em>, and finally followed by a <em >NORMAL</em> empty
        element,
    </ul>
<p>
<h2 >TYPEDEF</h2>
<p>
The <strong >typedef SplitPair</strong> represents <strong >std::pair&lt;std::string,
String::Type&gt;</strong> and is used by some overloaded <strong >split</strong> members (see
below).
<p>
<h2 >STATIC MEMBER FUNCTIONS</h2>
    <ul>
<p>
<li> <strong >char const **argv(std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; const &amp;words)</strong>:<br/>
        Returns a pointer to an allocated series of pointers to the <strong >C</strong>
strings stored in the vector <em >words</em>. The caller is responsible for
returning the array of pointers to the common pool, but should <em >not</em> delete
the <strong >C</strong>-strings to which the pointers point. The last element of the
returned array is guaranteed to be a 0-pointer. 
<p>
<li> <strong >int casecmp(std::string const &amp;lhs, std::string const &amp;rhs)</strong>:<br/>
        Performs a case-insensitive comparison of the contents of two
<em >std::string</em> objects. A negative value is returned if <em >lhs</em> should be
ordered before <em >rhs</em>; 0 is returned if the two strings have identical
contents; a positive value is returned if the <em >lhs</em> object should be ordered
beyond <em >rhs</em>.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::string escape(std::string const &amp;str, 
            char const *series = "'\"\\")</strong>:<br/>
       Returns a copy of <em >str</em> in which all characters in <em >series</em> are
        prefixed by a backslash character.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::string join(std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; const &amp;words, char sep)</strong>:<br/>
       The elements of the <em >words</em> vector are returned as one string,
        separated from each other by the <em >sep</em> character;
<p>
<li> <strong >std::string join(std::vector&lt;SplitPair&gt; const &amp;entries, char sep, 
                                                        bool all = true)</strong>:<br/>
       The <em >first</em> fields of the elements in <em >entries</em> are returned as one
        string, separated from each other by the <em >sep</em> character. If the
        parameter <em >all</em> is specified as <em >false</em> then elements whose
        <em >second</em> fields are equal to <em >String::SEPARATOR</em> are ignored.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::string lc(std::string const &amp;str) const</strong>:<br/>
       Returns a copy of <em >str</em> in which all letters were transformed to
        lower case letters.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::vector&lt;String::SplitPair&gt; split(std::string const &amp;str, SplitType
        mode, char const *sep = " \t")</strong>:<br/>
       The string <em >str</em> is split into substrings, separated by any of the
        characters in <em >sep</em>. The substrings are returned in a vector of
        <em >SplitPair</em> elements, using the specified <em >SplitType</em> mode
        (cf. the description of the various <em >SplitPair</em> values and their
        effects in the <em >ENUMERATIONS</em> section).
<p>
<li> <strong >std::vector&lt;String::SplitPair&gt; split(std::string const &amp;str, char
        const *separators = " \t", bool addEmpty = false)</strong>:<br/>
       This member acts like the previous one, using <em >addEmpty == false</em>
        to select <em >mode TOK</em> and <em >addEmpty == true</em> to select <em >mode
        TOKSEP</em>.
<p>
<li> <strong >size_t split(std::vector&lt;String::SplitPair&gt; *entries, std::string
        const &amp;str, SplitType mode, char const *sep = " \t")</strong>:<br/>
       Same functionality as the first <em >split</em> member, but this member
        stores the <em >SplitPair</em> elements in the vector pointed at by the 
        <em >entries</em> parameter, first clearing the vector. This member returns
        the new value of <em >entries-&gt;size()</em>.
<p>
<li> <strong >size_t split(std::vector&lt;String::SplitPair&gt; *entries, std::string
        const &amp;str, char const *sep = " \t", bool addEmpty = false)</strong>:<br/>
       This member acts like the previous one, using <em >addEmpty == false</em>
        to select <em >mode TOK</em> and <em >addEmpty == true</em> to select <em >mode
        TOKSEP</em>.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; split(Type *type, std::string const &amp;str,
        SplitType stype, char const *sep = " \t")</strong>:<br/>
       Same functionality as the first <em >split</em> member, but this member
        merely stores the <em >first</em> fields of the <em >SplitPair</em> elements in
        the returned vector. The <em >String::Type</em> variable whose address is
        passed to the <em >type</em> parameter is set to <em >NORMAL</em> if the final
        entry was successfully determined; to <em >DQUOTE_UNTERMINATED</em> if a
        final closing double quote could not be found; to
        <em >SQUOTE_UNTERMINATED</em> if a final closing single quote could not be
        found; and to <em >ESCAPE_END</em> if the final character in <em >str</em> is a
        backslash character.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; split(Type *type, std::string
        const &amp;str, char const *sep = " \t", bool addEmpty = false)</strong>:<br/>
       This member acts like the previous one, using <em >addEmpty == false</em>
        to select <em >mode TOK</em> and <em >addEmpty == true</em> to select <em >mode
        TOKSEP</em>.
<p>
<li> <strong >size_t split(std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; *words, std::string const &amp;str,
        SplitType stype, char const *sep = " \t")</strong>:<br/>
       Same functionality as the first <em >split</em> member, but this member
        merely stores the <em >first</em> fields of the encountered <em >SplitPair</em>
        elements in the vector pointed at by <em >words</em>, first clearing the
        vector. This member returns the new value of <em >words-&gt;size()</em>.
<p>
<li> <strong >size_t split(std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; *words, std::string const &amp;str,
        char const *sep = " \t", bool addEmpty = false)</strong>:<br/>
       This member acts like the previous one, using <em >addEmpty == false</em>
        to select <em >mode TOK</em> and <em >addEmpty == true</em> to select <em >mode
        TOKSEP</em>.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::string trim(std::string const &amp;str)</strong>:<br/>
       Returns a copy of <em >str</em> from which leading and trailing blank
        characters were removed.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::string uc(std::string const &amp;str)</strong>:<br/> 
       Returns a copy of <em >str</em> in which all letters were capitalized. 
<p>
<li> <strong >std::string unescape(std::string const &amp;str)</strong>:<br/>
       Returns a copy of <em >str</em> in which the escaped (i.e., prefixed by a
        backslash) characters were interpreted. All standard escape characters
        (<em >\a</em>, <em >\b</em>, <em >\f</em>, <em >\n</em>, <em >\r</em>, <em >\t</em>, <em >\v</em>) are
        recognized. If an escape character is followed by <em >x</em> at most the
        next two characters are interpreted as a hexadecimal number. If an
        escape character is followed by an octal digit, then at most the next
        three characters following the <em >backslash</em> are interpreted as an
        octal number. In all other cases, the backslash is removed and the
        character following the backslash is kept.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::string urlDecode(std::string const &amp;str)</strong>:<br/>
       URL specifications use <em >%xx</em> encoding to encode characters, except
        for alpha-numeric characters and the characters <em >- _ .</em> and <em >~</em>,
        which are kept as-is. Other characters are encode by a <em >%</em>
        character, followed by two hexadecimal characters representing those
        characters' byte value. E.g., a blank space is encoded as <em >%20</em>, a
        plus character is encoded as <em >%2B</em>. The member <em >urlDecode</em> returns
        a <em >std::string</em> containing the decoded characters of the url-encoded
        string that is passed as argument to this member.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::string urlEncode(std::string const &amp;str)</strong>:<br/>
       See the member <em >urlDecode</em>: <em >urlEncode</em> returns a <em >std::string</em>
        containing the url-encoded characters of the characters in the string
        that is passed as argument to this member.
