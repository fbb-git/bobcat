<p>
<h2 >NAME</h2>FBB::Semaphore - Implements the Semaphore type designed by Dijkstra
<p>
<h2 >SYNOPSIS</h2>
    <strong >#include &lt;bobcat/semaphore&gt;</strong><br/>
<p>
Linking option: <em >-lpthread -lbobcat</em> 
<p>
<h2 >DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
According to <em >http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)</em> a
semaphore is a variable or abstract data type that is used for controlling
access, by multiple processes, to a common resource in a parallel programming
or a multi user environment. The <em >Semaphore</em> as a data type was designed
around 1962 by Edsger Dijkstra.
<p>
A useful way to think of a semaphore is as a record of how many units of a
particular resource are available, coupled with operations to safely (i.e.,
without race conditions) adjust that record as units are required or become
free, and, if necessary, wait until a unit of the resource becomes
available. 
<p>
Semaphores are a useful tool in the prevention of race conditions.  Semaphores
allowing an arbitrary resource count are called counting semaphores, while
semaphores which are restricted to the values 0 and 1 (or locked/unlocked,
unavailable/available) are called binary semaphores. Both types are supported
by Bobcat's implementation.
<p>
<h2 >NAMESPACE</h2>
    <strong >FBB</strong><br/>
    All constructors, members, operators and manipulators, mentioned in this
man-page, are defined in the namespace <strong >FBB</strong>.
<p>
<h2 >INHERITS FROM</h2>
    -
<p>
<h2 >CONSTRUCTORS</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >Semaphore(size_t nAvailable)</strong>:<br/>
        The constructor defines the semaphore's initial state. With a counting
semaphore <em >nAvailable</em> defines, e.g., the number of available locations in a
storage area. Locking/unlocking, supporting facilities to notify other waiting
threads is implemented via binary semaphores, which are initialized to 1 or 0.
A semaphore containing the value 0 blocks. I.e., its <em >wait</em> member waits
until its value is incremented by another thread, calling one of the
semaphore's <em >notify</em> members.
    </ul>
    Copy and move constructors are not available.
<p>
<h2 >MEMBER FUNCTIONS</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >void notify()</strong>:<br/>
       The internally maintained <em >available</em> value is incremented and one
        waiting thread (cf. the <em >wait</em> members below) is notified,
        reactivating that thread.
    <li> <strong >void notify_all()</strong>:<br/>
       The internally maintained <em >available</em> value is incremented and all
        waiting threads (cf. the <em >wait</em> members below) are notified. Only
        one waiting thread will be able to obtain the semaphore's lock and to
        reduce <em >available</em>, and that particular thread is thereupon
        reactivated. 
    <li> <strong >void set(size_t available)</strong>:<br/>
       This member blocks until it has obtained the lock of the <em >std::mutex</em>
        which is maintained internally by the <em >Semaphore</em> object. Next the
        <em >Semaphore's available</em> value receives the value of the member's
        argumnt, and the lock is released.
    <li> <strong >size_t size() const</strong>:<br/>
       Without trying to lock the <em >Semaphore</em> object's <em >mutex</em> the current
        value of the <em >Semaphore's available</em> value is returned.
    <li> <strong >void wait()</strong>:<br/>
       This member blocks for as long as the internally stored value
        (<em >available</em>) equals zero. When returning from <em >wait</em> the current
        thread holds the lock of the <em >std::mutex</em> which is maintained
        internally by the <em >Semaphore</em> object. <em >Notify</em> members are used to
        increment <em >available</em> and to inform <em >wait</em> that it may
        return. When multiple threads are waiting only one thread will stop
        waiting, while the remaining threads will continue to wait for another
        notification.
    <li> <strong >bool wait(Fun fun, Params &amp;&amp;...args)</strong>:<br/>
       This is a member template, where <em >Fun</em> is a function (object)
        receiving the argument passed to <em >wait</em>, and returning a
        <em >bool</em>. This member blocks until it has obtained the <em >Semaphore's</em>
        mutex lock, then, while its <em >available</em> value equals 0, waits until
        being notified. Once it has reacquired the lock after being notified
        <em >fun</em> is called, receiving <em >wait's</em> perfectly forwarded remaining
        arguments. This member returns <em >false</em> if <em >fun</em> returns
        <em >false</em>. It returns <em >true</em> if <em >fun</em> returns <em >true</em> and
        <em >available</em> was unequal zero following <em >fun</em> returning
        <em >true</em>. The function may therefore perform tasks outside of the
        <em >Semaphore</em> local environment, which might even involve updating the
        <em >Semaphore's</em> <em >available</em> value.
    <li> <strong >std::cv_status wait_for(std::chrono::duration&lt;Rep, Period&gt; const
                                                                &amp;relTime)</strong>:<br/>
       This member blocks for as long as the internally stored value
        (<em >available</em>) equals zero and the amount of time specified by
        <em >relTime</em> hasn't passed. If the latter happens,
        <em >std::cv_status::timeout</em> is returned, otherwise
        <em >std::cv_status::no_timeout</em> is returned, in which case the current
        thread holds the lock of the <em >std::mutex</em> which is maintained
        internally by the <em >Semaphore</em> object. <em >Notify</em> members are used to
        increment <em >available</em> and to inform <em >wait</em> that it may
        return. When multiple threads are waiting only one thread will stop
        waiting, while the remaining threads will continue to wait for another
        notification.
    <li> <strong >std::cv_status wait_until(std::chrono::time_point&lt;Clock, Duration&gt; 
                                                            const &amp;absTime)</strong>:<br/>
       This member blocks for as long as the internally stored value
        (<em >available</em>) equals zero and the time specified by <em >absTime</em>
        hasn't been reached. If the latter happens (or if <em >absTime</em> lies in
        the past) <em >std::cv_status::timeout</em> is returned, otherwise
        <em >std::cv_status::no_timeout</em> is returned, in which case the current
        thread holds the lock of the <em >std::mutex</em> which is maintained
        internally by the <em >Semaphore</em> object. <em >Notify</em> members are used to
        increment <em >available</em> and to inform <em >wait</em> that it may
        return. When multiple threads are waiting only one thread will stop
        waiting, while the remaining threads will continue to wait for another
        notification.
