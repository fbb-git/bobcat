<h2 >NAME</h2>FBB::OFilterStreambuf - Base class for std::ostream filtering
<p>
<h2 >SYNOPSIS</h2>
    <strong >#include &lt;bobcat/ofilterstreambuf&gt;</strong><br/>
    Linking option: <em >-lbobcat</em> 
<p>
<h2 >DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
The <strong >FBB::OFilterStreambuf</strong> class is a specialization of the
<em >std::streambuf</em> class and can be used as a base class for classes
implementing <em >ostream</em>-filtering. 
<p>
Ostream filtering is defined here as the process by which inserted characters
are subject to processing before they are passed on to another (filtered)
<em >ostream</em> object (or they may be rejected). The filtering may also result in
inserting additional information into the filtered <em >ostream</em>.
<p>
<em >Chaining</em> of filters is also possible: the filtered <em >ostream</em> may itself
use an <em >OFilterStreambuf</em> to filter its received information before passing
it on to yet another <em >ostream</em>. 
<p>
As <em >OFilterStreambuf</em> inherits from <em >std::streambuf</em> an
<em >OFilterStreambuf</em> object can be used to provide an <em >ostream</em> object
with a <em >std::streambuf</em>. Information inserted into such a stream travels the
following route:
    <ul>
    <li> The information is converted to characters using the standard
conversion facilities implemented by <em >std::ostream</em> objects. E.g., when
inserting the value <em >123</em> this value is converted to 
the characters <em >'1', '2'</em> and <em >'3'</em>, respectively.
    <li> Each of the characters is then offered (in turn) to the
<em >std::streambuf</em> that is associated with the <em >ostream</em> object. In
particular, the <em >std::streambuf</em>'s <em >overflow()</em> member is called. 
    <li> <em >OFstreamBuf</em>'s default <em >overflow()</em> function ignores characters,
but specializations can override <em >overflow()</em> to process the received
characters <em >ad lib</em>. 
    <li> A overriding <em >overflow()</em> function has access to the member
<em >OFstreambuf::out()</em> which is a reference to the <em >std::ostream</em> receiving
the filtered information.
    </ul>
    To implement a simple copy-filter (i.e., all characters are accepted
as-is) a class must be derived from <em >OFilterStreambuf</em> providing an
overriding implementation of <em >overflow()</em>, e.g., as follows:
        <pre>

    int DerivedClass::overflow(int ch)
    {
        out().put(ch);
    }
        
</pre>

    Next this <em >std::streambuf</em> specialization can be associated with an
<em >ostream</em> into which information to be `copy filtered' can be inserted
(cf. the EXAMPLE section below).
<p>
<h2 >NAMESPACE</h2>
    <strong >FBB</strong><br/>
    All constructors, members, operators and manipulators, mentioned in this
man-page, are defined in the namespace <strong >FBB</strong>.
<p>
<h2 >INHERITS FROM</h2>
    std::streambuf
<p>
<h2 >CONSTRUCTORS</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >OFilterStreambuf()</strong>:<br/>
        This constructor creates a <em >OFilterStreambuf</em> object without
associating it with a destination (filtered) <em >ostream</em>.
<p>
<li> <strong >OFilterStreambuf(std::string const &amp;fname, 
                                            openmode mode = std::ios::out)</strong>:<br/>
        This constructor creates a <em >OFilterStreambuf</em> object and opens a
private <em >std::ofstream</em> object whose filename is provided and that should 
receive the filtered information.
<p>
<li> <strong >OFilterStreambuf(char const *fname, openmode mode = std::ios::out)</strong>:<br/>
        Same as the previous constructor, expecting a <em >char const *</em>
defining the name of the private <em >std::ofstream</em> object.
<p>
<li> <strong >OFilterStreambuf(std::ostream &amp;out)</strong>:<br/>
        This constructor creates a <em >OFilterStreambuf</em> object and will insert
any filtered information into the provided  <em >ostream</em> object.
    </ul>
    The class's destructor closes the destination (filtered) stream (cf. the
description of <em >close()</em> below).
<p>
<h2 >MEMBER FUNCTIONS</h2>
     All members of <strong >std::ostreambuf</strong> are available, as
<strong >FBB::OFilterStreambuf</strong> inherits from that class. In particular, derived
classes should provide their own implementation of <em >int underflow(int ch)</em>
to implement any non-trivial filtering.
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >void close()</strong>:<br/>
        This member calls the <em >streambuf::sync()</em> member to flush any
pending information to the destination (filtered) stream and then closes the
destination stream. Note that the default <em >sync()</em> member performs no
special actions but it can be overridden by derived classes to flush the
destination stream just prior to its closing.
<p>
<li> <strong >void open(std::string const &amp;fname, openmode mode = std::ios::out)</strong>:<br/>
        This member closes the current destination (filtered) <em >std::ostream</em>
object and associates the <em >OFilterStreambuf</em> object with a private
<em >std::ofstream</em> object whose filename is provided and that should receive
subsequently filtered information.
<p>
<li> <strong >void open(char const *fname, openmode mode = std::ios::out)</strong>:<br/>
        Same as the previous member, but using a <em >char const *</em> to specify
the name of the private <em >std::ofstream</em> object to receive the filtered
information.
<p>
<li> <strong >void open(std::ostream &amp;out)</strong>:<br/>
        This member closes the current destination (filtered) <em >std::ostream</em>
object and associates the <em >OFilterStreambuf</em> object with the provided
<em >ostream</em> object.
    </ul>
<p>
<h2 >PROTECTED MEMBER FUNCTION</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >std::ostream &amp;out() const</strong>:<br/>
        This member is available to derived classes to insert information into
the destination (filtered) stream. 
    </ul>
<p>
<h2 >EXAMPLE</h2>
        <pre>

    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    #include &lt;cctype&gt;
    #include &lt;bobcat/ofilterstreambuf&gt;
    
    class NoDigits: public FBB::OFilterStreambuf
    {
        private:
            int overflow(int ch) override
            {
                if (not isdigit(ch))
                    out().put(ch);
                return ch;
            }
            int sync() override
            {
                out() &lt;&lt; flush;
                return 0;
            }
    };
    
    using namespace FBB;
    using namespace std;
    
    int main()
    {
        NoDigits nod(cout);     // no digits to cout
        ostream out(&amp;nod);
    
        out &lt;&lt; in.rdbuf();      // rm digits from cin
        return 0;
    }
