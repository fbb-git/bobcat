<h2 >NAME</h2>FBB::OFdStreambuf - Output stream buffer initialized by a file descriptor
<p>
<h2 >SYNOPSIS</h2>
    <strong >#include &lt;bobcat/ofdstreambuf&gt;</strong><br/>
    Linking option: <em >-lbobcat</em> 
<p>
<h2 >DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <strong >FBB::OFdStreambuf</strong> objects may be used as a <strong >std::streambuf</strong> of
<em >std::ostream</em> objects to allow insertions into a file descriptor.
<p>
File descriptors are not defined within the context of <strong >C++</strong>,
but they can be used on operating systems that support the concept. Realize
that using file descriptors introduces operating system dependencies.
<p>
<h2 >NAMESPACE</h2>
    <strong >FBB</strong><br/>
    All constructors, members, operators and manipulators, mentioned in this
man-page, are defined in the namespace <strong >FBB</strong>.
<p>
<h2 >INHERITS FROM</h2>
    <strong >std::streambuf</strong>
<p>
<h2 >ENUMERATION</h2>
    The public enumeration <strong >Mode</strong> defined in the class <strong >FBB::OFdStreamBuf</strong>
has the following values:
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >CLOSE_FD</strong>, indicating that the file descriptor used by the object
must be closed;
    <li> <strong >KEEP_FD</strong> (the default) indicating that the file descriptor used by
the object must not be closed.
    </ul>
<p>
<h2 >CONSTRUCTORS</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >OFdStreambuf()</strong>:<br/>
        This constructor initializes the streambuf, without associating it to
a file descriptor, and without using buffering. The member <strong >open()</strong> can be
used to associate the object later on with a file descriptor and optionally a
buffer size.  When the object is destroyed or if the mode-less overloaded
version of the <strong >open</strong> member is called, the file descriptor will be closed.
<p>
<li> <strong >OFdStreambuf(Mode mode)</strong>:<br/>
        This constructor initializes the streambuf, without associating it to
a file descriptor, and without using buffering. The member <strong >open()</strong> can be
used to associate the object later on with a file descriptor and optionally a
buffer size.  When the object is destroyed or if the mode-less
overloaded version of the <strong >open</strong> member is called, the <strong >Mode</strong> argument
determines whether the file descriptor will be closed or will remain open.
<p>
<li> <strong >OFdStreambuf(int fd, size_t n = 1)</strong>:<br/>
        This constructor initializes the streambuf, associating it to file
descriptor <em >fd</em>, and an optional unget buffer size (by default having size
1).  When  <strong >open</strong> is called subsequently, or if the object is destroyed
the provided file descriptor will be closed.
<p>
<li> <strong >OFdStreambuf(int fd, size_t n = 1)</strong>:<br/>
        This constructor initializes the streambuf, associating it to file
descriptor <em >fd</em>, and an optional unget buffer size (by default having size
1).  When the object is destroyed or if the mode-less overloaded version of
the <strong >open</strong> member is called, the file descriptor will be closed.
<p>
<li> <strong >OFdStreambuf(int fd, Mode mode, size_t n = 1)</strong>:<br/>
        This constructor initializes the streambuf, associating it to file
descriptor <em >fd</em>, and an optional unget buffer size (by default having size
1).  When the object is destroyed or if the mode-less overloaded version of
the <strong >open</strong> member is called, the <strong >Mode</strong> argument determines whether the
file descriptor will be closed or will remain open.
    </ul>
    There are no copy or move constructors.
<p>
<h2 >MEMBER FUNCTIONS</h2>
     All members of <strong >std::streambuf</strong> are
available, as <strong >FBB::OFdStreambuf</strong> inherits from this class. Some of the
<strong >std::streambuf</strong>'s member are overridden by <strong >FBB::OFdStreambuf</strong>, see
below. 
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >void close()</strong>:<br/>
        The file descriptor used by the <em >OFdStreambuf</em> is closed,
irrespective of the <em >Mode</em> that was specified when the <em >OFdStreambuf</em>
object was constructed. Following <em >close</em> the <em >OFdStreambuf</em> object can
no longer be used until one of its <em >open</em> members has been called.
    <li> <strong >int fd() const</strong>:<br/>
        The file descriptor used by the <em >OFdStreambuf</em> object is returned. 
        If the <em >OFdStreambuf</em> is not associated with a file descriptor -1 is
        returned. 
    <li> <strong >void open(int xfd, size_t n = 1)</strong>:<br/>
        The streambuf is (re)initialized, using file descriptor <em >fd</em>, and an
optional unget buffer size (by default having size 1). When called repeatedly,
the <strong >Mode</strong> specification used whem the object was constructed determines
whether the file descriptor will be closed or will remain open.
    <li> <strong >void open(int xfd, Mode mode, size_t n = 1)</strong>:<br/>
        The streambuf is (re)initialized, using file descriptor <em >fd</em>, a file
descriptor closing parameter and an optional unget buffer size (by default
having size 1). Depending on the <strong >Mode</strong> argument the object's currently used
file descriptor will be closed or will remain open when the <em >IFdStreambuf</em>
object is destroyed.
    </ul>
    The overloaded assignment operator is not available.
<p>
<h2 >PROTECTED MEMBER FUNCTION</h2>
<p>
The member listed in this section implements the tasks of the comparably
named virtual function in the class's private interface. This separates the
redefinable interface from the user-interface. The class <strong >OFdStreambuf</strong>
can, in accordance with Liskov's Substitution Principle, be used as a
<em >std:streambuf</em>; but it also offers a facility for classes deriving from
<strong >OFdStreambuf</strong>. This facility is listed here.
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >int pSync()</strong>:<br/>
        The contents of the <strong >OFdStreambuf</strong>'s internal buffer are flushed. If
        writing the contents to the file descriptor fails, a warning message
        is displayed to the standard error stream.
    </ul>
