<p>
<h2>NAME</h2>FBB::OFoldStreambuf - Folds long lines written to ostream
<p>
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
    <strong>#include &lt;bobcat/ofoldstreambuf&gt;</strong><br>
    Linking option: <em>-lbobcat</em> 
<p>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <strong>FBB::OFoldStreambuf</strong> is a specialization of <em>FBB::OFilterStreambuf</em>
folding long lines written to an <em>std::ostream</em> object. The
<em>OFoldStreambuf</em> writes the (folded) lines to a second <em>ostream</em> (the
<em>destination stream</em> which is either used by or opened by the
<em>OFoldStreambuf</em> object).
<p>
Internally the <em>OFoldStreambuf</em> defines its actions using a little
finite state automation distinguishing three states (INDENT, WS and NON_WS)
and three character categories (<em>\n</em>, other white space characters (space),
and non-space characters). The nine combinations resulting from these two sets
are discussed below.
<p>
<em>OFoldStreambuf</em> objects will never fold lines in the middle of series
of non-blank characters (called a `word' below) but will always break a line
at a white space character. The resulting lines will always appear to the
right of a configurable left margin and to the left of a configurable right
margin. There is a somewhat pathological exception to this: if a word is too
long to fit in between the margins then the word will exceed the right hand
margin. 
<p>
The indentation used for the left margins is configurable to either blanks
(the default) or tabs. When tabs are used the width of a tab character is
configurable, using a default of 8 positions in the destination stream.
<p>
What follows is a description of the <em>Finite State Automaton</em> (FSA)
defining what happens when various character types appear at its three
states. The phrase `... is written' means that the described information is
written to the <em>ostream</em> used or opened by the <em>OFoldStreambuf</em>
object. <em>OFoldStreambuf</em>'s initial state is <em>INDENT</em>:

<h2>NAMESPACE</h2>
    <strong>FBB</strong><br>
    All constructors, members, operators and manipulators, mentioned in this
man-page, are defined in the namespace <strong>FBB</strong>.
<p>
<h2>INHERITS FROM</h2>
    FBB::OFilterStreambuf
<p>
<h2>ENUMERATION</h2>
    The enumeration <em>TabsOrBlanks</em> is used to select tabs or blanks when
writing the indentation. The default is blanks. When tabs are selected the
display width of tabs characters can be configured as well (using the default
of 8 positions for each tab-character). The enumeration has two values:
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>BLANKS</strong>:<br>
        The default, indicating that the left margin is specified and written
as a number of blanks;
    <li> <strong>TABS</strong>:<br>
        Indicating that the left margin is specified and written as a number
of tab-characters.
    </ul>
<p>
The enumeration <em>TrailingBlanks</em> is used to configure the
<em>OFoldStreambuf</em> object with respect to any trailing blanks that may appear
on the final line. These trailing blanks can appear on the final line it it is 
not properly terminated with a newline character but instead ends in white
space. By default these white space characters are ignored, but they may be
kept as well. The enumeration has two values:
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>IGNORE_TRAILING_BLANKS</strong>:<br>
        This indicates that trailing blanks appearing at the final line if it
is not terminated by a newline should not be written to the destination
<em>std::ostream</em>. This is the default used by <em>OFoldStreambuf</em> objects.
    <li> <strong>KEEP_TRAILING_BLANKS</strong>:<br>
        This indicates that trailing blanks at the final line if it is not
terminated by a newline should be written to the destination <em>std::ostream</em>
    </ul>
<p>
<h2>CONSTRUCTORS</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>OFoldStreambuf(size_t leftIndent = 0, size_t rightMargin = 80,
                    TabsOrBlanks tob = BLANKS,
                    TrailingBlanks tb = IGNORE_TRAILING_BLANKS)</strong>:<br>
        This constructor initializes an <em>OFoldStreambuf</em> object but does not
associate it with a destination stream. It can also be used as the default
constructor. 
<p>
<li> <strong>OFoldStreambuf(char const *fname,
                   size_t leftIndent = 0, size_t rightMargin = 80,
                    TabsOrBlanks tob = BLANKS,
                   TrailingBlanks tb = IGNORE_TRAILING_BLANKS)</strong>:<br>
    This constructor initializes an <em>OFoldStreambuf</em> object and opens (using
<em>std::ios::out</em>) the destination stream using the name specified as its
<em>fname</em> argument. 
<p>
<li> <strong>OFoldStreambuf(std::ostream &amp;stream,
                   size_t leftIndent = 0, size_t rightMargin = 80,
                    TabsOrBlanks tob = BLANKS,
                   TrailingBlanks tb = IGNORE_TRAILING_BLANKS)</strong>:<br>
    This constructor initializes an <em>OFoldStreambuf</em> object and uses as its
destination stream the <em>std::ostream stream</em>.
    </ul>
<p>
The destructor writes any buffered information to the destination stream
and will then flush the destination stream.
<p>
<h2>MEMBER FUNCTIONS</h2>
     All members of <strong>FBB::OFilterStreambuf</strong>, in particular its <em>out()</em> and
<em>open()</em> members are available, as <strong>FBB::OFoldStreambuf</strong> inherits from
this class.
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>void setMargins(size_t leftMargin, size_t rightMargin)</strong>:<br>
        This member can be used to modify the left- and right folding
margins. Note that the left margin may also be modified using the <em>FBB::lm</em>
and <em>FBB::mlm</em> manipulators.
<p>
<li> <strong>void setTrailingBlanks(TrailingBlanks tb)</strong>:<br>
        This member can be used to modify the currently used
<em>TrailingBlanks</em> parameter.
<p>
<li> <strong>void useBlanks()</strong>:<br>
        This member can be used to select blanks  to be used when inserting
left margins.
<p>
<li> <strong>void useTabs(size_t tabWidth = 8)</strong>:<br>
        This member can be used to select tab-characters to be used when
inserting left margins. The second parameter is used to specify the display
width of a tab-character.
    </ul>
<p>
<h2>STATIC MEMBER FUNCTIONS</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>size_t leftMargin(std::ostreambuf const *buffer)</strong>:<br>
        This member returns the current left margin setting of the
<em>OFoldStreambuf</em> object passed to it as its argument. The member defines a
<em>std::streambuf</em> parameter which is down cast to an <em>OFoldStreambuf</em> and
an <em>FBB::Exception</em> exception is thrown if that cast fails.
    <li> <strong>size_t rightMargin(std::ostreambuf const *buffer)</strong>:<br>
        This member returns the current right margin setting of the
<em>OFoldStreambuf</em> object passed to it as its argument. The member's parameter
is down cast in the same way as <em>leftMargin()</em>'s argument: an <em>FBB::Exception</em>
exception is thrown if that cast fails.
    </ul>
<p>
<h2>PROTECTED MEMBER FUNCTION</h2>
<p>
The member listed in this section implements the tasks of the comparably
named virtual function in the class's private interface. This separates the
redefinable interface from the user-interface. The class <strong>OFoldStreambuf</strong>
can, in accordance with Liskov's Substitution Principle, be used as a
<em>std:streambuf</em>; but it also offers a facility for classes deriving from
<strong>OFoldStreambuf</strong>. This facility is listed here.
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>int pSync()</strong>:<br>
        The contents of the <strong>OFoldStreambuf</strong>'s internal buffer is flushed.
    </ul>
<p>

    int main()
    {
        OFoldStreambuf fb(cout, 4, 40);
        ostream out(&amp;fb);

        out &lt;&lt; lm(4);

        string line;
        while (getline(cin, line))
            out &lt;&lt; line &lt;&lt; '\n';
    
        return 0;
    }
