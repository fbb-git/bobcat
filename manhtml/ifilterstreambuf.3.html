<h2 >NAME</h2>FBB::IFilterStreambuf - Filtering stream buffer initialized by a std::istream object
<p>
<h2 >SYNOPSIS</h2>
    <strong >#include &lt;bobcat/ifilterstreambuf&gt;</strong><br/>
    Linking option: <em >-lbobcat</em> 
<p>
<h2 >DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <strong >FBB::IFilterStreambuf</strong> objects may be used as a <strong >std::streambuf</strong> for
<em >std::istream</em> objects, filtering the information produced by those objects.
<p>
The class <em >IFilterStreambuf</em> was designed with the <strong >openSSL BIO</strong>
(cf. <strong >bio</strong>(3ssl)) in mind. Since the BIO concept was developed in the
context of the <strong >C</strong> programming language, BIOs do not support <strong >C++</strong>
streams. Nonetheless, the concept of a filtering device is an attractive one,
and is offered by the <strong >FBB::IFilterStreambuf</strong> class.
<p>
In addition to filtering, <strong >IFilterStreambuf</strong> objects use split buffers,
and thus, depending on the (configurable) size of buffer that is maintained by
<strong >IFilterStreambuf</strong> objects, usually multiple characters read from the
<strong >IFilterStreambuf</strong> can be pushed back again.
<p>
The class <strong >IFilterStreambuf</strong> is an abstract base class. It is used via
classes that are derived from <strong >IFilterStreambuf</strong>, implementing its pure
virtual <em >load</em> member (see below at <strong >PRIVATE VIRTUAL MEMBER FUNCTIONS</strong>).
<p>
<h2 >NAMESPACE</h2>
    <strong >FBB</strong><br/>
    All constructors, members, operators and manipulators, mentioned in this
man-page, are defined in the namespace <strong >FBB</strong>.
<p>
<h2 >INHERITS FROM</h2>
    <strong >std::streambuf</strong>
<p>
<h2 >MEMBER FUNCTIONS</h2>
     All members of <strong >std::streambuf</strong> are available, as <strong >IFilterStreambuf</strong>
inherits from this class. Some of the <strong >std::streambuf</strong>'s member are
overridden by <strong >IFilterStreambuf</strong>, see the next section.
<p>
Overloaded move and/or copy assignment operators are not available.
<p>
<h2 >PROTECTED CONSTRUCTOR</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >IFilterStreambuf(size_t bufSize = 1000)</strong>:<br/>
        This constructor initializes the streambuf, using a buffer of the
indicated size. While the streambuf is being used, its buffer is gradually
filled. Eventually, when it is full the oldest characters are removed from the
buffer, making room for more recent characters. At most half the <em >bufSize</em>
number of characters will be removed during a single refill. The constructor
ensures that the size of the buffer will always be at least 100.
    </ul>
    Copy- and move constructors are not available.
<p>
<h2 >PROTECTED MEMBER FUNCTION</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong >void setBuffer()</strong>:<br/>
        This member initializes the base class's buffer pointers (i.e.,
<em >eback, gptr,</em> and <em >egptr</em>) with the initial range of characters retrieved
by <em >filter</em> (see below). 
<p>
The member <em >setBuffer</em> should only once be called from the derived
class's constructor. Once it has been called, the <em >peek</em> member of the
<em >std::istream</em> that is initialized with the <strong >IFilterStreambuf</strong> will return
the next available character, even if no other stream operation has as yet
been performed. If it is not called by the derived class's constructor, then
<em >peek</em> returns 0 until at least one character has been retrieved from the
<em >istream</em> object.
    </ul>
<p>
<h2 >PRIVATE VIRTUAL MEMBER FUNCTIONS</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong >virtual bool filter(char const **srcBegin, char const **srcEnd) = 0</strong>:<br/>
        The <em >filter</em> member is declared as a pure virtual member: derived
classes <em >must</em> override <em >filter</em> with their own implementation. 
<p>
Derived class objects are responsible for obtaining information (in any
amount) from the device with which they interact. This information is then
passed on to the <em >IFilterStreambuf</em> via two pointers, pointing,
respectively, to the first available character and beyond the last available
character. The characters indicated by this range are subsequently transferred
by the <strong >IFilterStreambuf</strong> object to its own buffer, from where they are then
retrieved (or to where they can be pushed back) by the application. 
<p>
The <em >filter</em> member allows implementations to filter and/or modify the
information that is obtained by this member. The <strong >EXAMPLE</strong> section below
provides an example filtering out a configurable set of characters from a
provided <em >std::istream</em>. Bobcat's classes <strong >ISymCryptStreambuf</strong>(3bobcat)
and <strong >IBase64Streambuf</strong>(3bobcat) provide additional examples of classes
derived from  <strong >IFilterStreambuf</strong>.
<p>
The <em >filter</em> member should return <em >false</em> if no (more) information is
available. It should return <em >true</em> if information is available, in which
case <em >*srcBegin</em> and <em >*srcEnd</em> should be pointing to, respectively, the
first character and beyond the last character made available by <em >filter</em>;
    <li> <strong >int pbackfail() final override</strong>:<br/>
        The <em >pbackfail</em> member is final; derived classes cannot override
it. Currently it merely returns <em >EOF</em>. This may change in future
implementations. 
    <li> <strong >std::streamsize showmanyc() final override</strong>:<br/>
        The <em >showmanyc</em> member is final; derived classes cannot override
it. It returns the current number of characters that are (still) waiting to
be processed in the range of characters returned by the latest <em >filter</em>
call. 
    <li> <strong >int underflow() final override</strong>:<br/>
        The <em >underflow</em> member is final; derived classes cannot override
it. It calls <em >filter</em>, and refreshes at most
half the size of its internal buffer with characters from the range of
characters that was returned by the most recent call of <em >filter</em>.
    </ul>
    The <em >final</em> attribute was added to the above three members to give
<em >IFilterStreambuf</em> objects full control over their own buffers. 
<p>
<h2 >EXAMPLE</h2>
<p>
Here is a class, derived from <em >IFilterStreambuf</em>, filtering out a
predefined set of characters. It is used twice to filter digits and
vowels, to illustrate chaining of <strong >IFilterStreambuf</strong> objects.
