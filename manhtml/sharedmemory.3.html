<h2 >NAME</h2>FBB::SharedMemory - Shared Memory memory structure
<p>
<h2 >SYNOPSIS</h2>
    <strong >#include &lt;bobcat/sharedmemory&gt;</strong><br/>
    Linking option: <em >-lbobcat </em> 
<p>
<h2 >DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
The class <strong >FBB::SharedMemory</strong> implements a usable interface to a shared
memory segment made available by <em >FBB::SharedSegment</em> and monitored by
<em >FBB::SharedPos</em>. It is the main building block for
<em >FBB::SharedStreambuf</em>, defining the `device' to which
<em >FBB::SharedStreambuf</em> interfaces. All shared memory related I/O should be
performed by <strong >FBB::SharedMemory</strong> objects, which are true objects, not
themselves residing in shared memory. 
<p>
An <strong >FBB::SharedMemory</strong> object defines, connects to and manages access to
shared memory, encapsulating all raw shared memory operations. In addition to
the class <strong >FBB::SharedMemory</strong> the header file <em >bobcat/sharedmemory</em> also
defines a <strong >struct SharedEnum__</strong> defining <strong >enum SizeUnit</strong> within the
namespace <em >FBB</em>.
<p>
The requested amount of shared memory is always a lower bound to the maximum
amount of shared memory that eventually may become available. When defining a
<strong >SharedMemory</strong> object not all of its potentially available shared memory is
immediately allocated. Shared memory will be allocated by the <strong >SharedMemory</strong>
object once needed (up to a calculated maximum).
<p>
As a fictitious example: assume 100 kB of memory is requested. The
<strong >SharedMemory</strong> object then maintains a table of, e.g., 10 entries, each
entry controlling access to a shared memory block of 10 kB. These 10 kB blocks
aren't immediately allocated, but become available once the program reads from
or writes to addresses located in these data blocks. Newly allocated data
blocks are initialized to 0-bytes.
<p>
Caveat: when constructing a shared memory segment make sure the segment's
ID is stored at a retrievable location. This allows other processes to access
the shared segment. The shared segment ID is also required to delete a shared
memory segment. If the shared segment ID is lost, the memory occupied by the
shared memory segment remains inaccessible (although they can be retrieved and
removed by additional means, like <strong >ipcs</strong>(1) and <strong >ipcrm</strong>(1)). The member
<em >id</em> returns the ID of the shared memory currently monitored by an
<strong >FBB::SharedMemory</strong> object.
<p>
<h2 >NAMESPACE</h2>
    <strong >FBB</strong><br/>
    All constructors, members, operators and manipulators, mentioned in this
man-page, are defined in the namespace <strong >FBB</strong>.
<p>
<h2 >INHERITS FROM</h2>
    <strong >FBB::SharedEnum__</strong>
<p>
The <strong >struct SharedEnum__</strong> is a wrapper struct around <strong >enum SizeUnit</strong>,
which is available through inheritance in several <strong >FBB::Shared*</strong> classes,
and offers symbolic constants defining standard memory sizes. The <strong >enum
SizeUnit</strong> defines the following symbolic constants:
        <ul>
        <li> <strong >kB</strong>, representing 1024 (2**10) bytes of memory;
        <li> <strong >MB</strong>, representing 1048576 (2**20) bytes of memory;
        <li> <strong >GB</strong>, representing 1073741824 (2**30) bytes of memory
        </ul>
<p>
<h2 >CONSTRUCTORS, DESTRUCTOR</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong >SharedMemory()</strong>:<br/>
       The default constructor defines an empty stub, which cannot immediately
        be used.  As the <strong >SharedMemory</strong> class supports move assignment,
        empty stubs can easily be (re)configured at any time after their
        construction.
<p>
<li> <strong >SharedMemory(size_t maxSize, SizeUnit sizeUnit, size_t access = 0600)</strong>:<br/>
       This constructor creates a shared memory segment having a capacity of
        at least <em >maxSize * sizeUnit</em> bytes. The shared memory's access
        rights are defined by the <em >access</em> parameter, using the well-known
        (<strong >chmod</strong>(1)) octal values to define access rights for the owner, the
        group and others. If construction succeeds the shared memory is ready
        for use. If construction fails, an <em >FBB::Exception</em> is thrown.
<p>
<li> <strong >SharedMemory(int id)</strong>:<br/>
       This constructor connects to a shared memory segment having ID
        <em >id</em>. If construction succeeds the shared memory is ready for
        use. If construction fails (e.g., no shared memory segment having ID
        <em >id</em> exists), an <em >FBB::Exception</em> is thrown.
<p>
<li> <strong >~SharedMemory()</strong>:<br/>
       The destructor detaches any attached shared memory segments from
        the <strong >FBB::SharedMemory</strong> object. If the shared memory segment is
        currently locked by the <strong >FBB::SharedMemory</strong> object, the lock is
        removed.
    </ul>
<p>
copy and move constructors are not available.
<p>
<h2 >OVERLOADED OPERATORS</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >std::ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp;out, 
                                    SharedMemory const &amp;sharedMemory)</strong>:<br/>
       The overloaded insertion operator inserts information about the
        <em >SharedMemory</em> object into the provide <em >ostream</em> object. The IDs
        of the shared segments, their sizes, the maximum number of shared
        memory segments, the number of bytes that can be read from the shared
        memory, and its actual storage capacity, etc., are displayed.
<p>
<li> <strong >SharedMemory &amp;operator=(SharedMemory &amp;&amp;rhs)</strong>:<br/>
       The overloaded move assignment operator is available. It is used to
        (re)define the shared memory segment an <strong >FBB::SharedMemory</strong> object
        is interfacing with.
    </ul>
<p>
The overloaded copy assignement operator is not available.
<p>
<h2 >MEMBER FUNCTIONS</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >size_t blockOffset() const</strong>:<br/>
       The offset within the shared segment data block matching <em >offset</em>'s
        return value is returned. 0 is returned if the <strong >SharedMemory</strong>
        object has not yet been connected to a shared memory block.
<p>
<li> <strong >void clear()</strong>:<br/>
       First, the shared memory is locked. Next, all shared data segment are
        deleted, and the shared memory's own data are reset to indicate it is
        completely empty. Following this the shared memory segment is unlocked
        again. Returning from <em >clear</em> the shared memory The
        <strong >FBB::SharedMemory</strong> object is effectively re-initialized, with
        <em >offset</em> and <em >nReadable</em> returning 0.
<p>
An <em >FBB::Exception</em> is thrown if the <strong >SharedMemory</strong> object has not
        yet been connected to a shared memory block.
<p>
<li> <strong >size_t dataSegmentSize() const</strong>:<br/>
       Returns the size (in bytes) of shared memory data block. 0 is returned
        if the <strong >SharedMemory</strong> object has not yet been connected to a shared
        memory block.
<p>
<li> <strong >int get()</strong>:<br/>
       First the <strong >FBB::SharedMemory</strong> object calls <em >lock</em> to lock the
        shared memory segment. Next the character at <em >offset</em> is retrieved
        and <em >offset</em> is incremented. Then <em >unlock</em> is called, and the
        retrieved character is returned. If <em >offset</em> is at least equal to
        <em >nReadable, EOF</em> is immediately returned.
<p>
An <em >FBB::Exception</em> is thrown if the <strong >SharedMemory</strong> object has not
        yet been connected to a shared memory block.
<p>
<li> <strong >int id() const</strong>:<br/>
       The ID of the shared memory segment is returned. Following <em >kill</em>
        <em >id</em> returns -1, indicating that the shared segment cannot be used
        anymore (note that <em >operator=</em> can be used to re-initialize the
        <strong >FBB::SharedMemory</strong> object).
<p>
<li> <strong >SharedType *install(std::streamsize *offset, 
                           Params &amp;&amp;...params)</strong>:<br/>
       This member was implemented as a member template, using <em >typename
        SharedType</em> and <em >typename ...Params</em>, allowing perfect forwarding of
        arguments to <em >SharedType</em>'s constructor.
<p>
This member installs a <em >SharedType</em> object at <strong >SharedMemory's</strong> at
        <strong >SharedMemory</strong>'s first available offset: either at the current
        offset, or (if <em >SharedType's</em> size is too big to fit in the current
        data block at offset) at the first byte of the next <em >SharedSegment</em>
        shared data block.
<p>
The actual offset where the <em >SharedType</em> object is installed is
        returned in <em >*offset</em>, unless a <em >nullptr</em> is passed as
        <em >install's</em> first argument.
<p>
A pointer to the installed <em >SharedType</em> is returned, with
        <em >shmem.offset</em> pointing just beyond <em >SharedType's</em> last byte. 
<p>
The <em >SharedType</em> object is installed using placement new. E.g., the
        following example illustrates how a <strong >SharedMutex</strong>(3bobcat) object
        can be installed at the first possible 
        location of <em >SharedMemory shmem</em>:
            <pre>

    std::streamsize offset;
    FBB::SharedMutex *mutexPtr = shmem.install&lt;FBB::SharedMutex&gt;(&amp;offset); 
            
</pre>

       If the installed object must be destroyed, its destructor must
        explicitly be called. E.g., to destroy the <em >Mutex</em> pointed at by
        <em >mutexPtr</em> use <em >mutexPtr-&gt;~SharedMutex()</em>.
<p>
An <em >FBB::Exception</em> is thrown if <em >shmem</em> could not install the
        object in its shared memory data blocks.
<p>
<li> <strong >void kill()</strong>:<br/>
       Without locking the shared memory all shared memory controlled by the
        <strong >SharedMemory</strong> object is deleted. The <strong >SharedMemory</strong> object is
        unusable after returning from <em >kill</em>, with its <em >id</em> member returns
        -1. Nothing happens if this member is called when the <strong >SharedMemory</strong>
        object has not yet been connected to a shared memory block.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::streamsize maxOffset() const</strong>:<br/>
       The maximum possible offset that can be used with the shared memory
        segment is returned. The members <em >offset</em> and <em >nReadable</em> never
        exceed the value returned by <em >maxOffset</em>. 0 is returned if the
        <strong >SharedMemory</strong> object has not yet been connected to a shared memory
        block.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::streamsize nReadable() const</strong>:<br/>
       The number of characters (bytes) that can be read from the beginning of
        the shared memory is returned. 0 is returned if the <strong >SharedMemory</strong>
        object has not yet been connected to a shared memory block.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::streamsize offset() const</strong>:<br/>
       The offset within the shared memory segment (i.e., relative to the
        segment's <em >ios::beg</em> position) is returned. 0 is returned if the
        <strong >SharedMemory</strong> object has not yet been connected to a shared memory
        block.
<p>
<li> <strong >char *ptr()</strong>:<br/>
        Returns 0 if <em >offset() == maxOffset()</em>. Otherwise it returns a
        pointer to the character at index <em >offset</em> within the shared memory
        segment.
<p>
An <em >FBB::Exception</em> is thrown if the <strong >SharedMemory</strong> object has not
        yet been connected to a shared memory block.
<p>
<li> <strong >int put(int ch)</strong>:<br/>
       After locking the appropriate shared data segment, <em >ch</em> is written at
        position <em >offset</em>, incrementing <em >offset</em> thereafter. If <em >ch ==
        EOF, EOF</em> is immediately returned.
<p>
An <em >FBB::Exception</em> is thrown if the <strong >SharedMemory</strong> object has not
        yet been connected to a shared memory block.
<p>
<li> <strong >int read(Type *value)</strong>:<br/>
       This member was implemented as a member template. It calls
        the next member, casting <em >Type *</em> to <em >char *</em>, and using
        <em >sizeof(Type)</em> as its second argument.  The number of
        bytes actually read is returned. This member returns -1 if
        initially <em >offset</em> was at least equal to <em >nReadable</em>.
<p>
An <em >FBB::Exception</em> is thrown if the <strong >SharedMemory</strong> object has not
        yet been connected to a shared memory block.
<p>
<li> <strong >int read(char *data, std::streamsize len)</strong>:<br/>
       While locking the appropriate shared data segment(s) at most <em >len</em>
        bytes are read from the shared memory, starting at <em >offset</em>. The
        bytes read from shared memory are stored at <em >data</em>.  The number of
        bytes actually read is returned. This member returns -1 if
        initially <em >offset</em> was at least equal to <em >nReadable</em>.
<p>
An <em >FBB::Exception</em> is thrown if the <strong >SharedMemory</strong> object has not
        yet been connected to a shared memory block.
<p>
<li> <strong >int read(std::ios::off_type offset, Type *value,
                  std::ios::seekdir origin = std::ios::beg)</strong>:<br/>
       This member was implemented as a member template. After changing the
        <strong >SharedMemory</strong>'s offset to <em >offset</em> (relative to <em >origin</em>), it
        calls the first <em >read</em> member, passing it <em >value</em>. The number of
        bytes actually read is returned. This member returns -1 if initially
        <em >offset</em> was at least equal to <em >nReadable</em>.
<p>
An <em >FBB::Exception</em> is thrown if the <strong >SharedMemory</strong> object has not
        yet been connected to a shared memory block.
<p>
<li> <strong >void remove()</strong>:<br/>
       The shared memory is locked, after which all shared memory controlled
        by the <strong >FBB::SharedMemory</strong> object is deleted. The
        <strong >FBB::SharedMemory</strong> object is unusable after returning from
        <em >remove</em>.
<p>
An <em >FBB::Exception</em> is thrown if the <strong >SharedMemory</strong> object has not
        yet been connected to a shared memory block.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::ios::pos_type seek(std::ios::off_type offset, 
                            std::ios::seekdir origin = std::ios::beg)</strong>:<br/>
       Moves the <em >offset</em> position relative to <em >way</em>. The value -1 is
        returned when seeking before offset 0 or beyond <em >maxOffset</em>,
        otherwise the offset relative to the begin location of the shared
        memory (i.e, <em >offset</em> for <em >origin == ios::beg</em>) is returned.  0 is
        returned if the <strong >SharedMemory</strong> object has not yet been connected to
        a shared memory block.
<p>
<li> <strong >std::streamsize showmanyc() const</strong>:<br/>
       The number of characters that can be read from the current shared
        segment data block is returned.  This member interrogates the number
        of readable characters in the shared memory segment. This number may
        change while this member is being executed. In order to receive a
        stable return value, calling functions should have obtained a lock on
        the shared memory segment before calling this member. 0 is returned if
        the <strong >SharedMemory</strong> object has not yet been connected to a shared
        memory block.
<p>
<li> <strong >void swap(SharedMemory &amp;other)</strong>:<br/>
       The current and other <strong >FBB::SharedMemory</strong> objects are swapped.
<p>
<li> <strong >bool truncate(std::streamsize offset)</strong>:<br/>
       If <em >offset</em> is not exceeding the value returned by <em >nReadable</em>
        <em >nReadable</em> is changed to <em >offset</em> and <em >true</em> is
        returned. Otherwise <em >false</em> is returned, and the value returned by
        <em >nReadable</em> is not changed. 
<p>
An <em >FBB::Exception</em> is thrown if the <strong >SharedMemory</strong> object has not
        yet been connected to a shared memory block.
<p>
<li> <strong >int write(Type const *value)</strong>:<br/>
       This member was implemented as a member template. It calls the next
        member, casting <em >Type const *</em> to <em >char const *</em>, and using
        <em >sizeof(Type)</em> as its second argument.  The number of bytes actually
        written is returned. This member returns -1 if initially <em >offset</em>
        was at least equal to <em >maxOffset</em>.
<p>
An <em >FBB::Exception</em> is thrown if the <strong >SharedMemory</strong> object has not
        yet been connected to a shared memory block.
<p>
<li> <strong >int write(char const *data, std::streamsize len)</strong>:<br/>
       The <strong >FBB::SharedMemory</strong> object calls <em >lock</em> to lock the shared
        memory, and writes at most <em >len</em> bytes into the shared memory,
        starting at <em >offset</em>. Next, <em >unlock</em> is called. The number of
        bytes actually written is returned. The member function returns -1 if
        initially <em >offset</em> is equal to <em >maxOffset</em>.
<p>
An <em >FBB::Exception</em> is thrown if the <strong >SharedMemory</strong> object has not
        yet been connected to a shared memory block.
<p>
<li> <strong >int write(std::ios::off_type offset, Type const *value,
                  std::ios::seekdir origin = std::ios::beg)</strong>:<br/>
       This member was implemented as a member template. After changing the
        <strong >SharedMemory</strong>'s offset to <em >offset</em> (relative to <em >origin</em>), it
        calls the first <em >write</em> member, passing it <em >value</em>. The number of
        bytes actually written is returned. This member returns -1 if
        initially <em >offset</em> was at least equal to <em >maxOffset</em>.
<p>
An <em >FBB::Exception</em> is thrown if the <strong >SharedMemory</strong> object has not
        yet been connected to a shared memory block.
