<h2 >NAME</h2>FBB::IFdStreambuf - Input stream buffer initialized by a file descriptor
<p>
<h2 >SYNOPSIS</h2>
    <strong >#include &lt;bobcat/ifdstreambuf&gt;</strong><br/>
    Linking option: <em >-lbobcat</em> 
<p>
<h2 >DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <strong >FBB::IFdStreambuf</strong> objects may be used as a <strong >std::streambuf</strong> of
<em >std::istream</em> objects to allow extractions from a file descriptor.
<p>
File descriptors are not defined within the context of <strong >C++</strong>,
but they can be used on operating systems that support the concept. Realize
that using file descriptors introduces operating system dependencies.
<p>
<h2 >NAMESPACE</h2>
    <strong >FBB</strong><br/>
    All constructors, members, operators and manipulators, mentioned in this
man-page, are defined in the namespace <strong >FBB</strong>.
<p>
<h2 >INHERITS FROM</h2>
    <strong >std::streambuf</strong>
<p>
<h2 >ENUMERATION</h2>
    The public enumeration <strong >Mode</strong> defined in the class <strong >FBB::IFdStreamBuf</strong>
has the following values:
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >CLOSE_FD</strong>, indicating that the file descriptor used by the object
must be closed;
    <li> <strong >KEEP_FD</strong> (the default) indicating that the file descriptor used by
the object must not be closed.
    </ul>
<p>
<h2 >CONSTRUCTORS</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >IFdStreambuf()</strong>:<br/>
        This constructor initializes the streambuf, without associating it to
a file descriptor, and without using buffering. The member <strong >open()</strong> can be
used subsequently to associate the object with a file descriptor and
optionally a buffer size. When the object is destroyed or if the mode-less
overloaded version of the <strong >open</strong> member is called, the file descriptor will
not be closed.
<p>
<li> <strong >IFdStreambuf(Mode mode)</strong>:<br/>
        This constructor initializes the streambuf, without associating it to
a file descriptor, and without using buffering. The member <strong >open()</strong> can be
used subsequently to associate the object with a file descriptor and
optionally a buffer size. When the object is destroyed or if the mode-less
overloaded version of the <strong >open</strong> member is called, the <strong >Mode</strong> argument
determines whether the file descriptor will be closed or will remain open.
<p>
<li> <strong >IFdStreambuf(int fd, size_t n = 1)</strong>:<br/>
        This constructor initializes the streambuf, associating it to file
descriptor <em >fd</em>, and an optional unget buffer size (by default having size
1).  When the object is destroyed or if the mode-less overloaded version of
the <strong >open</strong> member is called, the file descriptor will not be closed.
<p>
<li> <strong >IFdStreambuf(int fd, Mode mode, size_t n = 1)</strong>:<br/>
        This constructor initializes the streambuf, associating it to file
descriptor <em >fd</em>, and an optional unget buffer size (by default having size
1).   When the object is destroyed or if the mode-less
overloaded version of the <strong >open</strong> member is called, the <strong >Mode</strong> argument
determines whether the file descriptor will be closed or will remain open.
    </ul>
    There is no copy constructor.
<p>
<h2 >MEMBER FUNCTIONS</h2>
     All members of <strong >std::streambuf</strong> are
available, as <strong >FBB::IFdStreambuf</strong> inherits from this class. Some of the
<strong >std::streambuf</strong>'s member are overridden by <strong >FBB::IFdStreambuf</strong>, see
below. 
    <ul>
    <li> <strong >void close()</strong>:<br/>
        The file descriptor used by the <em >IFdStreambuf</em> is closed,
irrespective of the <em >Mode</em> that was specified when the <em >IFdStreambuf</em>
object was constructed. Following <em >close</em> the <em >IFdStreambuf</em> object can
no longer be used until one of its <em >open</em> members has been called.
    <li> <strong >int fd() const</strong>:<br/>
        The file descriptor used by the <em >IFdStreambuf</em> object is returned.
        If the <em >OFdStreambuf</em> is not associated with a file descriptor -1 is
        returned. 
    <li> <strong >void open(int xfd, size_t n = 1)</strong>:<br/>
        The streambuf is (re)initialized, using file descriptor <em >fd</em>, and an
optional unget buffer size (by default having size 1). When called repeatedly,
the <strong >Mode</strong> specification used whem the object was constructed determines
whether the file descriptor will be closed or will remain open.
    <li> <strong >void open(int xfd, Mode mode, size_t n = 1)</strong>:<br/>
        The streambuf is (re)initialized, using file descriptor <em >fd</em>, a file
descriptor closing parameter and an optional unget buffer size (by default
having size 1). Depending on the <strong >Mode</strong> argument the object's currently used
file descriptor will be closed or will remain open when the <em >IFdStreambuf</em>
object is destroyed.
    </ul>
<p>
Note that there is no overloaded assignment operator available for this
class. 
<p>
<h2 >EXAMPLE</h2>
    To do
<p>
<h2 >FILES</h2>
    <em >bobcat/ifdstreambuf</em> - defines the class interface
<p>
<h2 >SEE ALSO</h2>
    <strong >bobcat</strong>(7), <strong >ifdstream</strong>(3bobcat), <strong >ofdstreambuf</strong>(3bobcat), 
    <strong >std::streambuf</strong>
<p>
<h2 >BUGS</h2>
    The member <em >xsgetn(char *dest, std::streamsize n)</em> will set
<em >istream::good()</em> to <em >false</em> when fewer bytes than <em >n</em> were read using
<em >istream::read()</em>. Also see <em >xsgetn</em>'s description.
<p>
Note that by default the provided file descriptors remain open. The
complementary class <strong >ofdstreambuf</strong>(3bobcat) <em >closes</em> the file descriptor
by default. This inconsistency was deliberately accepted to keep the classes
interfaces backward compatible.
