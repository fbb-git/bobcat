The (shared) Bobcat library contains classes and templates used by, e.g., the
Stealth and Bisonc++ programs. 

The Bobcat library contains a variety of C++ classes and templates, some of
them based on well-known Design Patterns. The library offers classes
handling, e.g.,
    Child Processes, Forks, Pipes and Redirection
    Command-to-Function associations
    Command-line arguments and history handling
    Command-line editing using streams
    Configuration Files
    Decryption and Encryption
    Extended String Operations
    Hash-tables
    Integers of unlimited size
    File-descriptor based streams (e.g. handle sockets using streams)
    Mail headers and mail filtering (milters)
    Message Digests
    Pattern matching
    Processes, Signals, Threads
    Shared Memory
    Single (Direct) Key Input
    Syslog- and other kinds of messages
    Temporary files
    Universal Type Conversions (Templates)

To create the library from its sources, either descend into the bobcat
directory, or unpack a created archive, cd into its top-level directory 
and follow the instructions provided in the INSTALL file found there.

Alternatively, binary ready-to-install versions of the Bobcat library are
available in verious Linux distributions, in particular Debian. See, e.g.,
