bobcat (1.10.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  [ Frank B. Brokken ]
  * Changed make/xxx scripts to construction scripts based on icmake. Debian
    now uses icmake scripts, and INSTALL.im to define the locations of the
    various targets. Added the directory ./icmake.

  [ George Danchev ]
  * drop all patches since have been merged upstream
  * new build-depends: icmake, tetex-bin, tetex-extra, gs-gpl | gs

bobcat (1.10.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  *  License changed to the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. See the file
    `copyright'. 

    Introduced George Danchev <danchev@spnet.net> as uploader

    CmdFinder now properly clears beyond() when using mode USE_FIRST

    From now on this file will only reflect Debian-specific changes. See the
    newly added file changelog for `upstream' changes. At this point, 
    changelog will be a copy of debian's changelog file.

bobcat (1.9.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Following suggestions made by George Danchev, this version was compiled by
    the unstable's g++ compiler (version >= 4.1), which unveiled several flaws
    in the library's class header files. These flaws were removed (i.e.,
    repaired).

    In order to facilitate compiler selection, the compiler to use is defined
    in the INSTALL.cf file.

    The debian control-files (i.e., all files under the debian subdirectory)
    were removed from the source distribution, which is now also named in
    accordance with the Debian policy. A diff.gz file was added.

    At the contents level: the class ConfigFile was extended with two
    overloaded members index(), returning line offset of the original
    configuration file associated with a particular line that may be retrieved
    from the ConfigFile object itself.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue,  4 Jul 2006 21:17:56 +0200

bobcat (1.8.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * make/install script slightly modified: header files are copied before the
            compilation starts to prevent unavailable header files.
    Added the following classes:
        * CmdFinder and CmdFinderBase: CmdFinder is a class handling
                command-lookup and command-function associations
        * OneKey: Objects of the class OneKey allow single-keystroke input (not
                requiring `Enter' to be pressed.
        * RefCount: Base class allowing its derived classes to share their
                memory, using reference counting.
    Modified the layout and contents of the file README.class-setup to improve 
    the current class organization's representation.

bobcat (1.7.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bobcat now `lintianized'. The libraries are now in the libbobcat1 and
    libbocat1-dev packages. The package's info has been upgraded. Note that
    packages depending on bobcat (e.g., stealth and bisonc++) require an
    upgrade as well.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 26 May 2006 15:02:22 +0200

bobcat (1.7.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * milter and xpointer are included optionally. `make/library all' includes
    them automatically

    New class Indent and associated manipulators implementing indentation
    defined.
    
    ofdstreambuf and ifdstreambuf constructors have additional parameters to
    either close or keep open the file descriptor that is passed to the
    constructor. The default situation is for ofdstreambuf to close the file
    descriptor and for ifdstreambuf to keep de file descriptor open. Thus the
    new implementation is backward compatible with earlier bobcat versions.
    
    Msg has a new free function msgstream() returning the not-cleared msg()
    stream. This allows certain STL algorithms to be used, see `man -e bobcat
    msg' 
    
    wrap1c and wrap2c now also accept const contexts; see, e.g., `man -e
    bobcat wrap1c'. Errors in wrap2c's template definition repaired.
    
    ConfigFile now has additional members beginRE() and endRE(), allowing
    iterators to produce all lines matching a RE.
    Repaired ConfigFile in accordance with the man-page: 
        initial ws are now removed from the stored lines, 
        find(target): `target' may be found anywhere within a configuration
                      line.

bobcat (1.6.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * minor repair in Pattern- and Selector manpages

    added MultiStrambuf, IOStreambuf, IOStream: see the manpages for details.

    redesigned Process: insertions insert to the child process, extractions
    extract from the child process. STDOUT and STDERR can or cannot be
    merged. See the man-page for details.

    redesigned Arg: same functionality as before, but allows for multiple
    specifications of options, also those having arguments. When multiple
    options having arguments are specified, each individual argument is
    retrievable. 

    added string::escape()
    
    `get...' accessors removed from all classes, (Arg, Fork and Pipe)
    Old names are kept for the time being.

bobcat (1.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * The general bobcat manpage did not have links to wrap1c and wrap2c. Now 
    Repaired. 

    The Log-class interface is modified. See the man -e bobcat log manpage for
    details. The main difference is that a static initialize() member is now
    used to define the static Log-object. Also, logs may be written to stdout
    using a simpler specification than before. The Log class also supports an
    open() member, allowing you to open a local Log object after its
    construction. 

    Added the class Milter, offering a C++ interface to the (sendmail)
    libmilter API. This class uses the `virtual constructor' Design Pattern to
    prevent the need for saving and accessing private connection based data
    using the libmilter api smfi_setpriv() and smfi_getpriv(). See `man -e
    bobcat milter' for details.

    Added the class Xpointer, setting and retrieving the X-windows pointer
    coordinates. 

    With the shared object library, functions from both libmilter and libX11
    must be available before a program can be fully linked. To prevent
    unnessary linking to these libraries, required dummy C functions were
    added to the bobcat library. When using libmilter and/or libX11, that
    these libraries should be mentioned to the linker before libbobcat.

bobcat (1.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * 1.4.0 and beyond: compiled with g++-4.0 compiler series.

    Further support of the 1.2.x series is discontinued
