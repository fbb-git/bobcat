<h1>FBB::TableSupport(3bobcat)</h1>
<h2>libbobcat1-dev_1.10.0-x.tar.gz Protocol defining Base class</h2>
<h2>2005-2006</h2>


<p>
<h2>NAME</h2>FBB::TableSupport - Defines protocol for Table-support classes
<p>
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
    <strong>#include &lt;bobcat/tableSupport&gt;</strong><br>
    Linking option: <em>-lbobcat</em> 
<p>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    This class is designed as a (non-pure) base class for support-objects for
<strong>FBB::Table</strong> objects. By overriding its virtual functions users have control
over the way the actual layout of tables is defined. By default the virtual
members of this class implement plain, blank-space delimited table elements.
<p>
When this is not appropriate, a class should be derived from
<strong>FBB::TableSupport</strong> overriding those members that violate the programmer's
current intentions. Then, an object of this derived class may be presented 
to one of the <strong>FBB::Table</strong> constructors, resulting in modifications of the
default procedures used to disaplay separators between table elements.
<p>
<a name="namespace.inc"></a><h2>NAMESPACE</h2>
    <strong>FBB</strong><br>
    All constructors, members, operators and manipulators, mentioned in this
man-page, are defined in the namespace <strong>FBB</strong>.
<p>
<h2>INHERITS FROM</h2>
    -
<p>
<h2>CONSTRUCTORS</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>TableSupport()</strong>:<br>
        The default constructor
    <li> <strong>TableSupport(TableSupport const &amp;other) throw()</strong>:<br> 
    The standard copy constructor is available.
    </ul>
<p>
<h2>NON_VIRTUAL MEMBER FUNCTIONS</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>void setParam(std::ostream &amp;ostr, unsigned rows, 
                        std::vector&lt;unsigned&gt; const &amp;colWidth,
                        unsigned maxWidth)</strong>:<br>
        This member function defines the <strong>FBB::TableSupport</strong>'s essential
parameters: <br>
        <strong>ostr</strong> is a reference to the <strong>std::ostream</strong> into which the table
will be inserted; <br>
        <strong>rows</strong> defines the number of rows used by the table;<br>
        <strong>colWidth</strong> is a vector defining the widths of the individual columns
of the table. Its values are ignored when the next parameter is unequal to 0,
but in that case its <em>size</em> (its number of elements) <em>are</em> used;<br>
        <strong>maxWidth</strong> is the width of each column. If set to 0 <strong>colWidth</strong>'s
elements are used to determine the width of the individual columns.
<p>
Note that this member is normally not used by the programmer, but it is
called with appropriate values by <strong>FBB::Table</strong>.
    <li> <strong>void setParam(unsigned maxWidth)</strong>:<br>
        This member function defines the <strong>FBB::TableSupport</strong>'s <strong>maxWidth</strong>
parameter, holding the width of each column.
<p>
Note that this member is normally not used by the programmer, but it is
called with appropriate values by <strong>FBB::Table</strong>.
    </ul>
<p>
<h2>ACCESSORS</h2>
<p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>unsigned tableWidth() const</strong>:<br>
        Returns the width of the table.
    <li> <strong>unsigned nColumns() const</strong>:<br>
        Returns the table's number of columns.
    <li> <strong>std::ostream &amp;out() const</strong>:<br>
        Returns the <strong>std::ostream</strong> into which the table is inserted.
    </ul>
<p>
<h2>VIRTUAL MEMBER FUNCTIONS</h2>
<p>
The following member functions may be overridden in derived classes. There
default implementations are given together with their prototypes, below:
<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li> <strong>virtual void hline(unsigned row) const</strong>:<br>
        This member is called just before the indicated row (offset, not
number) is inserted into the <strong>std::ostream</strong>. Its line number is presented
as a line-reference. Its intended task is to write a (partial) horizontal
line either before the first row (row == 0) or between two rows of the table. 
        By default it performs no actions.
    <li> <strong>virtual void hline() const</strong>:<br>
        This member is called when the table's last line has been inserted 
into the <strong>std::ostream</strong>. Its intended task is to write a (partial) horizontal
line at the end of the table.
        By default it performs no actions.
    <li> <strong>virtual void vline(unsigned col) const</strong>:<br>
        This member is called just before the indicated column element
(offset, not number) is inserted into the <strong>std::ostream</strong>. Its column number
is presented as a reference. Its intended task is to write a separator either
before the first element of a row (col == 0) or between two subsequent
elements in the table's rows. By default it inserts one blank space.
    <li> <strong>virtual void vline() const</strong>:<br>
        This member is called once the last element in a row 
has been inserted 
into the <strong>std::ostream</strong>. Its intended task is to write a line separator,
terminating a line of the table.
        By default it inserts a new-line (<em>\n</em>) character.
    </ul>
