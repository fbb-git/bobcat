<h2>libbobcat1-dev_1.10.0-x.tar.gz File Descriptor Output Stream Buffer</h2>
<h2>2005-2006</h2>


<p>
<h2>NAME</h2>FBB::OFdStreambuf - Output stream buffer initialized by a file descriptor
<p>
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
    <strong>#include &lt;bobcat/ofdstreambuf&gt;</strong><br>
    Linking option: <em>-lbobcat</em> 
<p>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <strong>FBB::OFdStreambuf</strong> objects may be used as a <strong>std::streambuf</strong> of
<em>std::ostream</em> objects to allow extractions from a file descriptor.
<p>
File descriptors are not defined within the context of <strong>C++</strong>,
but they can be used on operating systems that support the concept. Realize
that using file descriptors introduces operating system dependencies.
<p>
<a name="namespace.inc"></a><h2>NAMESPACE</h2>
    <strong>FBB</strong><br>
    All constructors, members, operators and manipulators, mentioned in this
man-page, are defined in the namespace <strong>FBB</strong>.
<p>
<h2>INHERITS FROM</h2>
    <strong>std::streambuf</strong>
<p>
<h2>ENUMERATION</h2>
    The public enumeration <strong>Mode</strong> defined in the class <strong>FBB::OFdStreamBuf</strong>
has the following values:
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>CLOSE_FD</strong>, indicating that the file descriptor used by the object
must be closed;
    <li> <strong>KEEP_FD</strong> (the default) indicating that the file descriptor used by
the object must not be closed.
    </ul>
<p>
<h2>CONSTRUCTORS</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>Ofdstreambuf()</strong>:<br>
        This constructor initializes the streambuf, without associating it to
a file descriptor, and without using buffering. The member <strong>open()</strong> can be
used to associate the object later on with a file descriptor and optionally a
buffer size.  When the object is destroyed or if the mode-less overloaded
version of the <strong>open</strong> member is called, the file descriptor will be closed.
<p>
<li> <strong>Ofdstreambuf(Mode mode)</strong>:<br>
        This constructor initializes the streambuf, without associating it to
a file descriptor, and without using buffering. The member <strong>open()</strong> can be
used to associate the object later on with a file descriptor and optionally a
buffer size.  When the object is destroyed or if the mode-less
overloaded version of the <strong>open</strong> member is called, the <strong>Mode</strong> argument
determines whether the file descriptor will be closed or will remain open.
<p>
<li> <strong>OFdStreambuf(int fd, unsigned n = 1)</strong>:<br>
        This constructor initializes the streambuf, associating it to file
descriptor <em>fd</em>, and an optional unget buffer size (by default having size
1).  When  <strong>open</strong> is called subsequently, or if the object is destroyed
the provided file descriptor will be closed.
<p>
<li> <strong>OFdStreambuf(int fd, unsigned n = 1)</strong>:<br>
        This constructor initializes the streambuf, associating it to file
descriptor <em>fd</em>, and an optional unget buffer size (by default having size
1).  When the object is destroyed or if the mode-less overloaded version of
the <strong>open</strong> member is called, the file descriptor will be closed.
<p>
<li> <strong>OFdStreambuf(int fd, Mode mode, unsigned n = 1)</strong>:<br>
        This constructor initializes the streambuf, associating it to file
descriptor <em>fd</em>, and an optional unget buffer size (by default having size
1).  When the object is destroyed or if the mode-less overloaded version of
the <strong>open</strong> member is called, the <strong>Mode</strong> argument determines whether the
file descriptor will be closed or will remain open.
    </ul>
    There is no copy constructor.
<p>
<h2>MEMBER FUNCTIONS</h2>
     All members of <strong>std::streambuf</strong> are
available, as <strong>FBB::OFdStreambuf</strong> inherits from this class. Some of the
<strong>std::streambuf</strong>'s member are overridden by <strong>FBB::OFdStreambuf</strong>, see
below. 
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>void open(int xfd, unsigned n = 1)</strong>:<br>
        This member (re)initializes the streambuf, using file
descriptor <em>fd</em>, and an optional unget buffer size (by default having size
1). When called repeatedly, the <strong>Mode</strong> specification used whem the object
was constructed determines whether the file descriptor will be closed or will
remain open.
    <li> <strong>void open(int xfd, Mode mode, unsigned n = 1)</strong>:<br>
        This member (re)initializes the streambuf, using file
descriptor <em>fd</em>, a file descriptor closing parameter and an optional unget
buffer size (by default having size 1). Depending on the <strong>Mode</strong> argument the
object's currently used file descriptor will be closed or will remain open.
    <li> <strong>int overflow(int c)</strong>:<br>
        This member <em>overrides</em> the <strong>std::streambuf</strong> member. It is
called by <em>std::ostream</em> objects using <strong>OFdStreambuf</strong>. It calls
<em>sync()</em>, an then it puts the next available character into the buffer. It
returns the inserted character.
    <li> <strong>int sync()</strong>:<br>: <br>
        This member <em>overrides</em> the <strong>std::streambuf</strong> member. It writes
the buffer to the device associated with the file descriptor, and returns 0.
    </ul>
    Note that there is no overloaded assignment operator available for this
class.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<h2>FILES</h2>

<h2>SEE ALSO</h2>
    <strong>bobcat</strong>(7), <strong>ifdstreambuf</strong>(3bobcat), <strong>ofdstream</strong>(3bobcat)), 
    <strong>std::streambuf</strong>
<p>
<h2>BUGS</h2>
    Starting with bobcat version 1.7.0, open file descriptors will be closed
when the object is destroyed or if the object is re-opened. Note that this
differs from earlier implementations, in which the file descriptor remained
open.
