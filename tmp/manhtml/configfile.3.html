<h2>2005-2006</h2>


<p>
<h2>NAME</h2>FBB::ConfigFileile - A class processing standard unix-like configuration files
<p>
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
    <strong>#include &lt;bobcat/configfile&gt;</strong><br>
    Linking option: <em>-lbobcat</em> 
<p>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <strong>FBB::ConfigFile</strong> objects read standard <em>unix</em>-style configuration
files.  Lines are stored with initial white-space (blanks and tabs) removed.
If a line ends in \, then the next line (initial white-space removed) is
appended to the current line.
<p>
Information at and beyond the first <em>#</em> on individual lines is removed
if the <em>rmComment</em> flag is set to <strong>true</strong>.  In that case, lines containing
only blanks and tabs are not stored.
<p>
<a name="namespace.inc"></a><h2>NAMESPACE</h2>
    <strong>FBB</strong><br>
    All constructors, members, operators and manipulators, mentioned in this
man-page, are defined in the namespace <strong>FBB</strong>.
<p>
<h2>INHERITS FROM</h2>
    <strong>std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;</strong>
<p>
<h2>ENUMERATIONS</h2>
    The following enumerations are defined by the class <strong>FBB::ConfigFile</strong>:
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>Comment</strong>:<br>
        This enumeration has two values: <br>
        <strong>FBB::ConfigFile::KeepComment</strong> is used to indicate that comment on
lines must be kept; <br>
        <strong>FBB::ConfigFile::RemoveComment</strong> is used to indicate that comment on
lines must be removed;
    <li> <strong>SearchCasing</strong>:<br>
        This enumeration also has two values:<br> 
        <strong>FBB::ConfigFile::SearchCaseSensitive</strong> is used to do case sensitive
searches for targets;<br>
        <strong>FBB::ConfigFile::SearchCaseInsensitive</strong> is used to do case
insensitive searches for targets.
    <li> <strong>Indices</strong>:<br>
        This enumeration also has two values:<br> 
        <strong>FBB::ConfigFile::IgnoreIndices</strong> when used, the line numbers of the
original configuration file will not be made available;<br>
        <strong>FBB::ConfigFile::StoreIndices</strong> when used, the line numbers of the
original configuration file will be made available;<br>
    </ul>
<p>
<h2>CONSTRUCTORS</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>Configfile(Comment cType = KeepComment, SearchCasing sType =
            SearchCaseSensitive, Indices iType = IgnoreIndices)</strong>:<br>
        This constructor is used to create an empty <strong>FBB::ConfigFile</strong>
object. It is not associated with an input stream: the <strong>open()</strong> member can
be used for that. The parameters can be used to specify specific handling of
comment, letter-casing and storage of line numbers in the original
configuration file.
    <li> <strong>Configfile(std::string const &amp;fname, Comment cType = KeepComment,
            SearchCasing sType = SearchCaseSensitive, 
            Indices iType = IgnoreIndices)</strong>:<br>
        This constructor is used to create a <strong>FBB::ConfigFile</strong> object, which
is filled with the information from a file whose name is provided as the
constructor's first argument. The other parameters are used as described with
the first constructor.
    <li> <strong>Configfile(FBB::ConfigFile const &amp;other)</strong>:<br>
        The copy constructor is available.
    </ul>
<p>
<h2>MEMBER FUNCTIONS</h2>
     All members of <strong>std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;</strong>  are
available, as <strong>FBB::ConfigFile</strong> inherits from this class.
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>ConfigFile::const_RE_iterator beginRE(std::string const &amp;target) const</strong>:<br>
        This member returns a <em>const</em> iterator to the first element (i.e.,
line) of the <strong>FBB::ConfigFile</strong> object in which the regular expression
<em>target</em> is found. <strong>FBB::Pattern</strong> is used to perform the pattern
matching. If the <em>RemoveComment</em> flag was specified, then comment-text is
not searched.  The returned iterator can be incremented until <strong>endRe()</strong> is
reached; all iterators will point to lines matching the specified regular
expression.  This member also interprets the <em>SearchCasing</em> flag.
    <li> <strong>ConfigFile::const_RE_iterator endRE() const</strong>:<br>
        This member returns a <em>const</em> iterator marking the end of the series
of lines started at the the first line matching the regular expression
specified by <strong>beginRE()</strong>
    <li> <strong>ConfigFile::const_iterator find(std::string const &amp;target) const</strong>:<br>
        This member will return an iterator to the first element (i.e., line)
of the <strong>FBB::ConfigFile</strong> object in which <em>target</em> is found. Note that
<em>target</em> may appear anywhere within a line. If the <em>RemoveComment</em> flag
was specified, then comment-text is not searched. Use the
<strong>FBB::ConfigFile::end()</strong> member to determine the end-iterator. It is not
guaranteed that all lines between the returned iterator and <strong>end()</strong> will
also contain <em>target</em>.  This member also interprets the <em>SearchCasing</em>
flag.
    <li> <strong>ConfigFile::const_iterator findRE(std::string const &amp;target) const</strong>:<br>
        This member returns an iterator to the first element (i.e., line) of
the <strong>FBB::ConfigFile</strong> object in which the regular expression <em>target</em> is
found. <strong>FBB::Pattern</strong> is used to perform the pattern matching. If the
<em>RemoveComment</em> flag was specified, then comment-text is not searched.  The
inherited <strong>FBB::ConfigFile::end()</strong> member can be used to determine the
end-iterator. It is not guaranteed that all lines between the returned
iterator and <strong>end()</strong> will also contain <em>target</em>. If that is required, the
members <strong>beginRE()</strong> and <strong>endRE()</strong> can be used.  This member also
interprets the <em>SearchCasing</em> flag.
    <li> <strong>unsigned index(unsigned idx)</strong>:<br>
        This function should only be used when the parameter <em>StoreIndices</em>
was specified at construction time. In that case it will return the original
0-based line index in the configuration file associated with the <em>idx</em>sup(th)
(0-based) index in the current <em>Configuration</em> object. 
    <li> <strong>unsigned index(const_iterator const &amp;iter)</strong>:<br>
        This function should only be used when the parameter <em>StoreIndices</em>
was specified at construction time. In that case it will return the original
0-based line index in the configuration file associated with the configuration
line in the current <em>Configuration</em> object pointed to by <em>iter</em>. This may
also be an (incremented version of the) iterator returned by the member
<em>findRE</em> or <em>beginRE</em>, as long as the iterator's value is within the half
open range <em>beginRE</em> to <em>endRE</em>.
    <li> <strong>void open(std::string const &amp;fname) throw(FBB::Errno)</strong>:<br>
        This member will read the configuration file having name <em>fname</em>.
It will redefine the current contents of the <strong>FBB::ConfigFile</strong> object,
destroying any information previously stored in it. The configuation file is
read according to the latest setting of the comment-flag. It will throw an
<em>FBB::Errno</em> exception if the file could not be opened.
    <li> <strong>void setCommentHandling(Comment type)</strong>:<br>
        This member can be used to change the comment-handling type originally
set by the constructor, or set by earlier calls of this function. When called
it won't affect the current contents of the <strong>FBB::ConfigFile</strong> object, but
new calls of its <em>open()</em> member will read the configuation file according
to the last setting of the comment flag.
    <li> <strong>void setSearchCasing(SearchCasing type)</strong>:<br>
        This member can be used to change the handling of the letter-casing
originally set by the constructor, or set by earlier calls of this
function. When called it won't affect the current contents of the
<strong>FBB::ConfigFile</strong> object, but new calls of its <em>open()</em> member will read
the configuation file according to the last setting of the letter-casing flag.
<p>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
    Assume the configuration file is called <em>config.rc</em> and contains the
following lines: 
<p>

    <pre>


# this is ignored

noline: this one too

line: this is found

this is not a line containing line: at the beginning of the line

line: this one is

    line: what about this one? \ 
        it's extending over multiple lines

and there may, of course, be more lines in this file
    
</pre>

<p>
The following program may be compiled and run as <em>a.out config.rc</em>:
    <pre>

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;iterator&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;bobcat/configfile&gt;

using namespace std;
using namespace FBB;
    
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    ConfigFile cf(argv[1]);     

    cout &lt;&lt; *cf.find("this one") &lt;&lt; endl; // find text within a line

                                         // find all lines matching 
                                         // `^line:'
    copy(cf.beginRE("^line:"), cf.endRE(), 
                    ostream_iterator&lt;string&gt;(cout, "\n"));
}
    
</pre>

<p>
Producing the output:
    <pre>

noline: this one too
line: this is found
line: this one is
line: what about this one? it's extending over multiple lines
    
</pre>
