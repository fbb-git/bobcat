manpagedescription()

    The information made available by bf(IQuotedPrintableStreambuf) objects is
either quoted-printable encoded or decoded. The information to convert is read
by bf(IQuotedPrintableStreambuf) objects via tt(std::istream) objects.

    The class bf(IQuotedPrintableStreambuf) is a class template, using a
tt(FBB::CryptType) template non-type parameter. Objects of the class
bf(FBB::IQuotedPrintableStreambuf<FBB::ENCODE>) encode the information they
receive, objects of the class bf(FBB::IQuotedPrintableStreambuf<FBB::DECODE>)
decode the information they receive. See also section bf(ENUMERATION) below.

    Quoted-printable encoding is sometimes used in e-mail attachments (See
also lurl(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoted-printable) and
lurl(https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt) (section 6.7)). Its main
characteristics are:
    itemization(
    it() Lines are at most 76 characters long;
    it() Lines longer than 76 characters are split into sub-lines, using
        tt(=\n) combinations to indicate `soft line breaks'. Lines not ending
        in soft line breaks indicate true end of lines.
    it() All printable characters, except for the tt(=) character and (final)
        blank characters just before the end of lines, are copied as-is, all
        other characters are escaped by writing tt(=XX) sequences, with XX
        being the ascii-character representation of the hexadecimal value of
        the escaped character (e.g., the tt(=) character is encoded as
        tt(=3D), a final space before end-of-line is encoded as tt(=20), a
        final tab as tt(=09)). Only capital letters are used when escaping
        characters.

    bf(FBB::IFilterStreambuf)

manpagesection(MEMBER FUNCTIONS)
     All members of bf(FBB::IFilterStreambuf) are available, as
bf(IQuotedPrintableStreambuf) inherits from this class.

    Overloaded move and/or copy assignment operators are not available.

manpagesection(ENUMERATION)

    bf(IQuotedPrintableStreambuf) objects either encode or decode
quoted-printable information. bf(IQuotedPrintableStreambuf) objects of the
class bf(FBB::IQuotedPrintableStreambuf<FBB::ENCODE>) encode the data they
receive, bf(IQuotedPrintableStreambuf) objects of the class
bf(FBB::IQuotedPrintableStreambuf<FBB::DECODE>) decode the data they receive.

The values tt(ENCODE) and tt(DECODE) are defined in the tt(enum CryptType),
defined in the tt(FBB) namespace.

manpagesection(CONSTRUCTOR)
    itemization(
    itb(IQuotedPrintableStreambuf<CryptType>(std::istream &in, size_t bufSize = 1000))
        This constructor initializes the streambuf.

    - tt(IQuotedPrintableStreambuf<ENCODE>) objects perform quoted-printable
        encoding;nl()
    - tt(IQuotedPrintableStreambuf<DECODE>) objects perform quoted-printable
        decoding;nl()
    - tt(IQuotedPrintableStreambuf<CryptType>) objects obtain the bytes to encode or
        decode from tt(std::istream &in);nl()
    - The tt(IFilterStreambuf) base class is initialized with a buffer of
        size tt(bufSize), using a lower bound of 100 characters.

    The constructor uses a configurable buffer size for reading. Characters
read into the buffer which are not part of the actual quoted-printable encoded
data are unavailable after completing the quoted-printable decoding. If
information beyond the quoted-printable input block should remain available,
then a buffer size of 1 should be specified.
    )

    Copy- and move constructors are not available.

manpagesection(EXAMPLE)

    The example shows the construction of tt(IQuotedPrintableStreambuf<ENCODE>)
objects tt(encode) which are used to initialize a tt(std::istream) object. The
information read from this tt(istream) is quoted-printable encoded. 

tt(IQuotedPrintableStreambuf<DECODE>) objects read quoted-printable encoded
information from tt(std::istream) objects, decoding the information.

The tt(std::istream din) object is initialized with the
tt(IQuotedPrintableStreambuf<DECODE>) object, and its contents is sent to
tt(std::cout). The information that is presented at tt(std::cin) and that
appears at tt(std::cout) should be identical.
