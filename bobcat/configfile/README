All lines are stored in the vector<string> base class.  When StoreIndices was
specified the 0-based line indices of lines were stored in d_index.

The member open clears the current contents and reinitializes all with the
info read from the new file.

At construction time comment handling (keep comment / remove comment),
case-sensitive searching (sensitive / insensitive) and index storage (store /
don't store) can be specified.

It can't be modified with the open member, but overloaded assignment is
supported and comment and letter case handling can be modified by set-members.
