bobcat (1.21.1) ISN

  * Several man-pages were updated/modified (Config, Log, Process, User, X2a)

  * ConfigFile: 
        added `std::string const &operator[](size_t idx) const' to the
    interface offering a basic protection against accidentally modifying
    the configuration file's lines by clients; 
       added member std::string findKeyTail(std::string key, size_t idx = 1)
    returning the contents beyond key of the idx-th line containing key.
 
  * Process: this class received an extensive overhaul resulting in multiple
    new members. See the Process man-page for details. Several of its former
    constructors and members are now deprecated and will be removed in a
    future release. Existing sources defining Process objects and the shared
    Bobcat library must be recompiled as the data member organization of
    Process has substantially been changed. Again consult the Process man-page
    for details.

  * Msg: added member open(ofstream &out, std::string const &name, size_t
    protection) opening an ofstream using a specified protection mode.

  * DateTime: TriVal's UNKNOWN value was changed; rfc2822() now correctly
    represents the difference between UTC and local time, allowing for DST.

  * The deprecated Arg::getInstance() member was removed. Arg::instance()
    should be used instead.

  * Added the new class ArgConfig combining the facilities of the Arg and
    Config classes.

bobcat (1.20.1)

  * Removed left-over cout stmnts from DateTime members

bobcat (1.20.0)

  * Removed deprecated members from String, removed the std::string base class
    from String

  * Moved inline private members to their internal header files where
    possible. Users of those classes will never need these inline members, so
    they can be used from the class interface, thus speeding up compilations.

  * Removed exception thrown from constructors of the following classes:
    Arg, Glob, OneKey, Pipe, ServerSocket, SocketBase, User, Xpointer

    Except for the classes Arg and ServerSocket these classes now define a
    public member 'verify()' which should be called following the construction
    of objects of these classes before using any other of their members. The
    verify() member throws the Errno exception if the object could not
    properly be constructed. As a safeguard verify() is also called from the
    classes' destructors, but in some programs that might be rather late,
    causing surprise for the program's users.

    The man-pages are updated accordingly.

    EXISTING PROGRAMS using the classes Arg, Glob, OneKey, Pipe, SocketBase,
                      or User should be recompiled, as the data-organization
                      of objects of these classes has changed. Xpointer's data
                      organization was not altered.
    To find all source (text) files using the above classes the script
    scripts/check1.20.0 could be used. 

  * Added missing namespace declarations to glob/driver/driver.cc

  * Repaired reporting the argv-argument before an undefined option instead of
    the undefined option itself as in, e.g., 
        tmp/bin/xd --verbose -tm
        ArgData::ArgData(): unknown option: --verbose
    or:
        tmp/bin/xd -tm
        ArgData::ArgData(): unknown option: tmp/bin/xd

  * Removed 'throw()' lists from various functions and man-pages (except
    from several Errno members, as their throw() lists are required
    by Errno's std::exception base class

  * Removed inline in inline virtual ~Errno() (needed because of a previous
    bug in g++, which has now been repaired)

  * Added missing mode() and specialMode() functions to Stat, and added info
    to the stat manpage indicating what fields of the 'struct stat' are
    returned by specific accessor members.

  * Added DayTime::setWeekday() member to DateTime to alter dates based on the
    day of the week. DateTime's man-page adapted accordingly.

bobcat (1.19.0)

  * Added the template function binary_search that returning iterator to the
    location of a found element rather than a bool value (as returned by the
    std::binary_search algorithm) telling its caller whether the searched for
    element is present or not

  * The Process class was given additional functionality allowing better
    control over the way child processes are started and the Process man-page
    was updated accordingly

  * The description of the member `header()' in the man-page of the class 
    Milter was improved

  * CGI's man-page now contains a common organization of a program using
    a CGI object

bobcat (1.18.1)

  * Repaired a flaw in Pattern due to which a segfault could occur becasue of
    a failure to initialize the Finite State Automaton processing Perl-like
    character-set abbreviations. Also the HANDLING OF BACKSLASHES by Pattern
    objects was modified: to specify a literal backslash is must now be
    specified twice. 
    NOTE that this change *may* require some maintenance of patterns that were
    hard-coded in programs already using the Pattern class. See the `pattern'
    man-page for details.

  * Removed all left-over redundant include guards
  
  * Renamed all identifiers (macro defines, etc.) that started with _ into
    names not starting with _. This only affects include-guard identifiers and
    symbols used internally, so programs using Bobcat should not be affected
    by this modification.

  * Added the files README.X11 and README.milter 

  * Several members of FBB::State were not documented in the bobcat/stat
    man-page: missing documentation is now included (TODO).

  * Added the class CGI processing forms submitted using the Common Gateway
    Interface 

  * Added for_each() and repeat() function templates (and their man-pages)

  * Reorganized the main bobcat man-page, adding a categorization of Bobcat's
    classes 

bobcat (1.17.2)

  * Arg's constructors changed in accordance with the new (?) getopt()
    function: missing option arguments are now properly recognized and no
    longer confused with `unknown options'

  * The Table man-page incorrectly listed `Table const &' as its second
    argument. The modifier `const' is incorrect as the insertion may imply
    the addition of empty elements to the table in order to make it
    rectangular. The `const' modifier was removed from the man-page.

bobcat (1.17.1)

  * Removed Wrap* wrappers from Bisonc++. Use FnWrap* instead.

  * Added member rfc2822() to DateTime returning the time according to
    RFC 2822 (e.g., as displayed by the `date -R' command.

  * Partial construction and installation of the Bobcat library is now 
    supported via #defines in INSTALL.im

  * Minor modifications to satify g++4-3's #include requirements

  * TEMPORARILY suppressed the `deprecated header warning' resulting from
    using ext/hash_map in bobcat/hash. The fix is a kludge: the warning is
    suppressed by defining the backward warning include guard identifier just
    prior to including ext/hash_map and by undefining it thereafter.

bobcat (1.17.0)

  * Repaired double free bug in Pattern
  
  * Changed the implementation and interface of MailHeaders. See 'man -e
    bobcat mailheaders' for details

  * Process::init() member removed. setCommand() added, and constructors no
    longer call the process start() member. They shouldn't as start() forks,
    and forking an object that isn't constructed yet seems to be
    inappropriate. The open() call in init() is now placed in
    start(). Therefore the correct sequence becomes: 
    Process(), start(), ...(insert/extract)..., stop(). Process::operator=()
    now performs: stop(), setCommand(), start(). Multiple stops() could be
    given, so ... stop(), operator=(), ... is acceptable.
    The Process man-page is updated accordingly.

  * The DateTime class has been enlarged. It now contains members to reassign
    individual time components as well as members to compare the (in)equality
    of the times represented by two DateTime objects. Trailing \n is not
    inserted anymore if a DateTime object is inserted into an
    ostream. Operators +, -, += and -= for DateTime rvalues removed, since a
    date is an interval scaled data type. It is, however, possible to add or
    subtract seconds (or even struct tm structs) and to add/set values to
    individual DateTime components.

  * Implemented lastFail() members in A2x and X2a. See the respective
    man-pages. 

bobcat (1.16.1)

  * The `build' script `library' command bow has an additional optional 
    argument `strip' to strip the shared library. By default the library is 
    not stripped.

bobcat (1.16.0)

  * Leftover `String' in string/unescape replaced by `std::string'.

  * Added missing A2x.to<Type>() member template to A2x (cf. C++ Annotations).
    
bobcat (1.15.0)

  * The Glob constructor no longer requires a static_cast when multiple flags
    are specified for its second argument.

  * The TableSupport class's vline(col) member now writes separator[col] to
    the output stream if it is available. If it is not available, no action is
    performed. Similarly, vline() now writes the trailing separator as well as
    a newline character. This is a more natural default behavior of
    TableSupport.

  * The Milter class interface  was adapted to libmilter-dev 8.14.1-2, 
    affecting milter/milter and milter/initialize.cc.

bobcat (1.14.2)

  * Added (still) missing headers to glob.ih, log.ih and tablesupport.ih
    required for proper compilation with g++ 4.3

  * The ServerSocket is created with the option SO_REUSEADDR, allowing servers
    to be restarted immediately following a shutdown of the server.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 13 Apr 2007 12:05:11 +0200

bobcat (1.14.1)

  * Member function template implementations consisting of a single line of
    code were given the `inline' specification.

  * The classes Table and TableSupport were redesigned. Their public and
    protected interfaces changed substantially.

  * Classes TableSpec, EqualWidth and ColumnWidth were developed for use with
    the Table class only. They are obsolete and were removed from the Bobcat
    library.

  * Added a new class Align allowing users to specify alignment of columns or
    elements of Table objects.

  * Added a support script contrib/c_conf contributed by Karel Kubat
    (karel at e dash unity dot org)

  * Included several missing header files fixing gcc/g++ 4.3 problems

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 28 Mar 2007 14:22:16 +0200

bobcat (1.13.1)

  * All function/member/constructor throw() specifications removed, following
    Sutter & Alexandrescu's suggestions (except where required by external
    classes, like std::exception.

  * RefCount's header missed `public:'. Repaired, thus making relase() et
    al. public members, conform the RefCount manual page.

  * Added template class `AutoPtr'

  * Added template classes FnWrap1, FnWrap1c, FnWrap2, FnWrap2c, obsoleting 
    Wrap1, Wrap1c, Wrap2, Wrap2c. Classes previously depending on the Wrap*
    classes were modified accordingly: they now use FnWrap*

bobcat (1.12.1)

  * inline virtual destructors have an explicit `inline' mentioned in their
    class interfaces to prevent compilation problems caused by a small g++
    (4.1.2) bug.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 30 Nov 2006 13:26:52 +0100

bobcat (1.12.0)

  * All classes have their inline-functions moved out of the interface. They
    are now implemented inline below the interface itself.

    X2a now has a copy constructor and an overloaded assignment operator

    A2x now has a copy constructor (which was announced in the man-page, but
    was never implemented).

    Table's functionality has been enlarged. Consult its manpage for details
    
    Redirector's `accessVia' member is now deprecated. Instead `swallow'
    should be used.

    The String class's object member functions are now deprecated. Instead
    static member functions have been defined offering the same
    functionality. 

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 15 Nov 2006 19:25:49 +0100

bobcat (1.11.0)

  * The classes Wrap1c, Wrap2 and Wrap2c were fully generalized, now accepting
    any combination of reference, pointer, const reference or const pointer
    argument types for both the function called from their operator()()
    function call operator and (with Wrap1c and Wrap2c) the local context
    struct. Since this results in an extension of the class's API, I upgraded
    to the next subversion. Since the Wrap* classes are templated classes, the
    library hasn't changed, and all programes previously compiled against
    libbobcat1 should continue to run without any required maintenance.

    The man-pages were updated accordingly. 

    The icmake-script was updated so that it runs on both icmake 6.xx and the
    upcoming icmake 7.xx release.

    Started to move inline definitions of members to below the class
    interface. Done for a2x and datetime.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 14 Oct 2006 14:47:37 +0200

bobcat (1.10.2)

  *  Andreas Jochens noted a build-problem for xpointer/get.cc on amd
    architectures and kindly provided a patch changing the definition
        size_t keys
    into 
        unsigned int keys.
    His patch was applied to this bobcat version.

  *  Added the file README.optimization describing why the compiler option
    -O3 is used.

  *  INSTALL.im redefines default DOC and DEVDOC locations to, resp. 

        BASE  = "/usr";
        DOC  =      BASE + "/share/doc/libbobcat1";
        DOCDEV  =   BASE + "/share/doc/libbobcat1-dev";

  * Removed installation of `lintian overrides' from icmake/install

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 31 Aug 2006 15:18:45 +0200

bobcat (1.10.1)

  *  Some leftover Academic Free License references were replaced by GPL
     references. 

    The previously used scripts below make/ are obsolete and were removed from
    this and future distributions. Icmake should be used instead, for which a
    top-level script (build) and support scripts in the ./icmake/ directory
    are available. Icmake is available on a great many architectures. See the
    file INSTALL (and INSTALL.im, replacing the previously used INSTALL.cf)
    for further details.

    Various source adaptations were realized (SF: superfluous):
        All plain `unsigned' variables were changed to `size_t'
        datetime: changed include time.h into include ctime
              removed SF include iostream from 
                    datetime/operatorminusis2.cc
                    datetime/operatorminusis3.cc
                    datetime/operatorminusis.cc
                    datetime/operatorplusis2.cc
                    datetime/operatorplusis3.cc
        fork: changed int d_pid into pid_t pid, various files, manpage adapted
        gethostent: changed `hostent *' into `struct hostent *' in
                    gethostent.cc 
        iostream: removed SF #include iostream from clear1.cc
        localclientsocket/localclientsocket: datamember SF
        localclientsocket/localclientsocket.ih: added includes for connect(2)
        localserversocket/localserversocket.ih: updated required includes
        mailheaders/read.cc: removed SF include iostream
        multistreambuf/multistreambuf: removed SF include iostream
        pattern/convert.cc: removed SF includes iostream and iomanip
        process/parentredirections.cc,stop.cc: removed SF include iostream
        selector/selector: including sys/select.h according to POSIX rather
                            than includes using earlier standards.

bobcat (1.10.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  *  License changed to the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. See the file
    `copyright'. 

    Introduced George Danchev <danchev@spnet.net> as uploader

    CmdFinder now properly clears beyond() when using mode USE_FIRST

    From now on this file will contain the `upstream' changes. The Debian
    related changes are in changelog.Debian.gz

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 18 Jul 2006 21:38:21 +0200

bobcat (1.9.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Following suggestions made by George Danchev, this version was compiled by
    the unstable's g++ compiler (version >= 4.1), which unveiled several flaws
    in the library's class header files. These flaws were removed (i.e.,
    repaired).

    In order to facilitate compiler selection, the compiler to use is defined
    in the INSTALL.cf file.

    The debian control-files (i.e., all files under the debian subdirectory)
    were removed from the source distribution, which is now also named in
    accordance with the Debian policy. A diff.gz file was added.

    At the contents level: the class ConfigFile was extended with two
    overloaded members index(), returning line offset of the original
    configuration file associated with a particular line that may be retrieved
    from the ConfigFile object itself.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue,  4 Jul 2006 21:17:56 +0200

bobcat (1.8.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * make/install script slightly modified: header files are copied before the
            compilation starts to prevent unavailable header files.
    Added the following classes:
        * CmdFinder and CmdFinderBase: CmdFinder is a class handling
                command-lookup and command-function associations
        * OneKey: Objects of the class OneKey allow single-keystroke input (not
                requiring `Enter' to be pressed.
        * RefCount: Base class allowing its derived classes to share their
                memory, using reference counting.
    Modified the layout and contents of the file README.class-setup to improve 
    the current class organization's representation.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 26 Jun 2006 08:42:18 +0200

bobcat (1.7.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bobcat now `lintianized'. The libraries are now in the libbobcat1 and
    libbocat1-dev packages. The package's info has been upgraded. Note that
    packages depending on bobcat (e.g., stealth and bisonc++) require an
    upgrade as well.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 26 May 2006 15:02:22 +0200

bobcat (1.7.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * milter and xpointer are included optionally. `make/library all' includes
    them automatically

    New class Indent and associated manipulators implementing indentation
    defined.
    
    ofdstreambuf and ifdstreambuf constructors have additional parameters to
    either close or keep open the file descriptor that is passed to the
    constructor. The default situation is for ofdstreambuf to close the file
    descriptor and for ifdstreambuf to keep de file descriptor open. Thus the
    new implementation is backward compatible with earlier bobcat versions.
    
    Msg has a new free function msgstream() returning the not-cleared msg()
    stream. This allows certain STL algorithms to be used, see `man -e bobcat
    msg' 
    
    wrap1c and wrap2c now also accept const contexts; see, e.g., `man -e
    bobcat wrap1c'. Errors in wrap2c's template definition repaired.
    
    ConfigFile now has additional members beginRE() and endRE(), allowing
    iterators to produce all lines matching a RE.
    Repaired ConfigFile in accordance with the man-page: 
        initial ws are now removed from the stored lines, 
        find(target): `target' may be found anywhere within a configuration
                      line. 

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue,  2 May 2006 19:31:02 +0200

bobcat (1.6.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * minor repair in Pattern- and Selector manpages

    added MultiStrambuf, IOStreambuf, IOStream: see the manpages for details.

    redesigned Process: insertions insert to the child process, extractions
    extract from the child process. STDOUT and STDERR can or cannot be
    merged. See the man-page for details.

    redesigned Arg: same functionality as before, but allows for multiple
    specifications of options, also those having arguments. When multiple
    options having arguments are specified, each individual argument is
    retrievable. 

    added string::escape()
    
    `get...' accessors removed from all classes, (Arg, Fork and Pipe)
    Old names are kept for the time being.
    
 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 26 Dec 2005 19:04:24 +0100

bobcat (1.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * The general bobcat manpage did not have links to wrap1c and wrap2c. Now 
    Repaired. 

    The Log-class interface is modified. See the man -e bobcat log manpage for
    details. The main difference is that a static initialize() member is now
    used to define the static Log-object. Also, logs may be written to stdout
    using a simpler specification than before. The Log class also supports an
    open() member, allowing you to open a local Log object after its
    construction. 

    Added the class Milter, offering a C++ interface to the (sendmail)
    libmilter API. This class uses the `virtual constructor' Design Pattern to
    prevent the need for saving and accessing private connection based data
    using the libmilter api smfi_setpriv() and smfi_getpriv(). See `man -e
    bobcat milter' for details.

    Added the class Xpointer, setting and retrieving the X-windows pointer
    coordinates. 

    With the shared object library, functions from both libmilter and libX11
    must be available before a program can be fully linked. To prevent
    unnessary linking to these libraries, required dummy C functions were
    added to the bobcat library. When using libmilter and/or libX11, that
    these libraries should be mentioned to the linker before libbobcat.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu,  8 Dec 2005 20:52:44 +0100

bobcat (1.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * 1.4.0 and beyond: compiled with g++-4.0 compiler series.
    Minor modifications in the log/log and level/level header files:
        ::operator<<() changed into operator<<()

    Further support of the 1.2.x series is discontinued

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 18 Nov 2005 21:44:13 +0100

bobcat (1.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * added missing constructor description in the Pattern manpage
    removed leftover cerr insertion from localserversocket::listen()
    
    defined default localsocketbase constructor.
    added /bobcat/localsocketbase/open.cc
    
    defined default localserversocket constructor.
    removed /bobcat/localserversocket/localserversocket1.cc
    added /bobcat/localserversocket/open.cc

    defined default localclientsocket constructor.
    defined LocalClientSocket::open()

    Pattern missed some throwlists in its implementations. Repaired.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 17 Nov 2005 14:05:26 +0100

bobcat (1.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the following classes:
    localsocketbase     - base class for unix domain sockets
    localserversocket   - defines server for unix domain sockets
    localclientsocket   - defined client for unix domain sockets
    randbuffer          - std::streambuf producing random numbers
    irandstream         - istream producing random numbers
    mailheaders         - handles SMTP mail message headers

    Repaired incorrect header inclusion in datetime.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Fri, 11 Nov 2005 16:47:31 +0100

bobcat (1.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Repaired -I statement in make/parameters, and changed tmp/inc into
    tmp/bobcat (repairs resulting from feedback by Vincent Hecht)
    Changed the ordering of the classes tablesupport and tablespec
    in CLASSES

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu,  8 Sep 2005 19:40:43 +0200

bobcat (1.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the compilation dependency on `icmake'. See INSTALL for
    instructions about how to compile and install bobcat yourself, rather than
    using the binary distribution

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat,  3 Sep 2005 16:47:24 +0200

bobcat (1.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the following classes:

       FBB::ClientSocket: a socket for tcp-communication with a server.
       FBB::columnWidth: Manipulator class for the class Table.
       FBB::DateTime: Manipulations with date and time values.
       FBB::equalWidth: Manipulator class for the class Table.
       FBB::GetHostent: Obtains hostent struct from hostname or -address.
       FBB::Glob: Obtain a list of files matching a certain pattern.
       FBB::Hostent: Wrapper around the hostent struct.
       FBB::Hostname:  Derived  from Hostent, allows the initialization from a
       FBB::IFdStream: stream extracting information from a device whose  file
       FBB::IFdStreambuf:  Input  stream buffer initialized by a file descrip-
       FBB::InetAddress: Base class (no public constructor) for objects repre-
       FBB::level: Manipulator setting the log-level of FBB::Log objects.
