manpagedescription()
    The bf(FBB::CinInserter) class offers a basic interface for calling
external programs (so-called child processes) reading their standard input
streams. The standard output and standard error streams of the child processes
are not handled by ttCinInserter) objects. The child's standard input is
provided through the tt(CinInserter) object: information inserted into an
tt(CinInserter) object is forwarded to the child process's standard input
stream. The tt(PATH) environment variable is not used when calling child
processes: child process programs must be specified using paths.

tt(CinInserter) objects may repeatedly be used to execute the same or
different child processes. Before starting the next child process, the current
child process must have finished.

Arguments passed to child processes may be surrounded by double or single
quotes. Arguments surrounded by double quotes have their double quotes
removed, while interpreting any escape-sequences that may have been used
within. Arguments surrounded by single quotes have their single quotes
removed, while accepting their contents as-is. In addition unquoted
escape-sequences may be specified: those escape sequences are evaluated and
replaced by their intended characters (e.g., tt(\100) is converted to tt(@)).

When information of undetermined size or structure must be inserted into a
child process then the child process cannot determine when to stop. This
creates an interesting problem: the child process starts, and the parent
process must wait until its child process has finished processing its
input. But input can only be forwarded to the child's input stream after the
child process has started. To solve this problem tt(InterterFork) offers an
overloaded tt(execute) member, passing information to the child process via a
separate thread.

manpagesection(CONSTRUCTOR)

    itemization(
    itb(CinInserter(size_t bufSize = 100))
        A tt(bufSize) argument may be specified: it defines the internal
buffer size used by the tt(CinInserter's) streambuf.
    )

manpagesection(MEMBERS)

    itemization(
    itb(bool execute(std::string const &cmd))
        This member can be used if the amount of information to forward to the
child process is known beforehand. If the amount of information is
undetermined, then then next  tt(execute) member should be used.

        The argument specifies the command to execute: the command itself must
be specified as a path (the tt(PATH) environment variable isn't used). The
member returns tt(true) if the child process's exit value equals 0. Otherwise
tt(false) is returned. Once tt(execute) has returned it can be called again,
either using the same or another command. The class tt(CinInserter) does not
offer facilities to forcefully terminate child processes: parent processes
are suspended until the child processes have completed. Arguments passed to
the program to be executed as child process may optionally be specified using
single or double quotes, as described in this man-page's DESCRIPTION section.

    itb(bool execute(std::string const &cmd, Fun &&fun))
        This member is defined as a member template. The tt(cmd) parameter
specifies the command to execute, and is defined identically as the tt(cmd)
parameter of the previous tt(execute) member. The parameter tt(fun) is a
function (or function object). The function argument that is passed to
tt(execute) is then perfectly forwarded to a separate thread, which provides
the information to be inserted into the tt(CinInserter) object. The tt(fun)
argument receives the current tt(CinInserter) object as a reference:
        verb(
std::thread thr{std::forward<Fun>(fun), std::ref(*this)};
        )
    Once the thread has started, it should insert information into the
tt(CinInserter) object, after which it should call tt(CinInserter's stop)
member.  The information is then processed by the tt(CinInserter) object, with
tt(execute) returning tt(true) if the child process's exit value equals 0.

    itb(int stop())
        Once all information has been inserted into the tt(CinInserter)
object tt(stop) should be called to inform the child process that all
information has been received. The tt(stop) member returns the child's exit
code. Sometimes  the input-protocol defined by the child process defines the
end of the input stream (like a line containing tt(quit)). In such cases
calling tt(stop) may not be necessary.

    itb(int ret() const)
        Once tt(execute) has returned this member provides the actual exit
code of the child process. Its value equals -1 before the first tt(exectue)
call.
