manpagedescription()

Objects of the class bf(CSV) can be used to convert series of comma separated
values to the individual separated values. These values may be converted
(individually or as a group) to standard integral types tt(int, size_t, long
long,) etc., to floating point types (tt(float, double, long double)), or they
can be accessed as tt(std::string) values.

manpagesection(TYPEDEFS AND ENUMS)

    The bf(enum Mode) specifies how a bf(CSV) is extracted from
tt(std::istream) objects:
    itemization(
    itt(TRAILINGCOMMA)  a series of comma-separated values ends at a final
        comma, which is removed from the tt(istream) by the bf(CSV) extraction
        operator. 
    itt(LINE) after extracting a bf(CSV) object any remaining characters on
        the current tt(std::istream) line are ignored (i.e., the extraction
        operator reads full lines of input).
    )
    These enumeration values may be combined using the tt(bit-or) operator.

    The bf(enum InserType) specifies how a bf(CSV) is inserted into
tt(std::ostream) objects:
    itemization(
    itt(LENGTH) indicates that all specifications (i.e., the em(length) of the
        type-specifications, see the member tt(length) below), are inserted
        into the tt(std::ostream) as a series of comma-separated values.
    itt(SIZE) indicates that all (not ignored) comma-separated fields (i.e.,
        the em(size) of the fields vector, see the member tt(size)
        below), are inserted into the tt(std::ostream) as a series of
        comma-separated values.
    itt(COUNT) indicates that all valid (i.e., the em(count) of the
        valid fields, see the member tt(count) below), are inserted
        into the tt(std::ostream) as a series of comma-separated values.
    )

manpagesection(CONSTRUCTORS)
    itemization(
    itb(CSV(std::string const &specification, Mode mode = LINE))
        The specification in tt(specification) defines the subsequent fields
        of the comma-separated value. Specifications are 
        quote(
            itemization(
            itt(S): the field is left as-is, and can be retrieved as a
                tt(std::string). 
            itt(I): the field represents an tt(int) value;
            itt(D): the field represents a tt(double) value;
            )
        )
        Specifications may be separated by space or tab characters, which are
        ignored. The number of specification characters determines the number
        of fields that are stored in a bf(CSV) object. The final field may or
        may not be followed by a comma. Each specification may also be
        followed by a positive integral value, indicating that number of
        comma-separated fields of the indicated type.

        By default the bf(CSV) extraction operator extracts complete lines
        from the stream from which a bf(CSV) object is extracted.
    )
    The default, copy, and move constructors are available.

manpagesection(OVERLOADED OPERATORS)
    itemization(
    itb(std::string const &operator[](size_t index) const)
       The contents of the indicated field is returned as a tt(std::string)
    )
    The copy and move assignment operators are available.

manpagesection(MEMBER FUNCTIONS)
    itemization(
    itb(Type get<Type = std::string>(size_t idx)
       The contents of field tt(idx) is returned as a value of type tt(Type). 
        All built-in types as well as tt(std::sting) are accepted.
