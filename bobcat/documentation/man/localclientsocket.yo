manpagedescription()
    An bf(FBB::LocalClientSocket) may be constructed to connect to a server
process in the Unix Domain Name. The socket made available by the
bf(FBB:LocalClientSocket) may be used to initialize a bf(std::istream) and/or
bf(std::ostream). The bf(std::istream) is used to read information from the
server process to which the bf(FBB::LocalClientSocket) connects, The
bf(std::ostream) is used to send information to the server process to which
the bf(FBB::LocalClientSocket) connects.  Since a socket may be considered a
em(file descriptor) the avaiable bf(FBB::IFdStream), bf(FBB::IFdStreamBuf),
bf(FBB::OFdStream), and bf(FBB::OFdStreamBuf) classes may be used profitably
here. Note that having available a socket does not mean that this defines the
communication protocol. It is (still) the responsibility of the programmer to
comply with an existing protocol or to implement a tailor-made protocol. The
latter situation implies that the sequence of input- and output operations is
defined by the programmer.

manpagesection(CONSTRUCTOR)
    itemization(
    itb(LocalClientSocket(std::string const &name) throw (Errno))
        This constructor initializes an bf(FBB::LocalClientSocket) object,
using the named Unix Domain Name socket to connect to the server using the
named Unix Domain Name socket. An
bf(FBB::Errno) is thrown if the socket could not be constructed. The
construction of the socket does not mean that a connection has actually been
established. In order to connect to the server, the member bf(connect()) (see
below) should be used.
    )
    The copy constructor is not available.

manpagesection(MEMBER FUNCTION)
    itemization(
    itb(int connect() throw (Errno))
        This member returns a socket that can be used to communicate with the
server process. An bf(FBB::Errno) exception is thrown if the connection could
not be established.
    )
