manpagedescription()
    bf(FBB::ReadLineBuf) objects may be used as a tt(std::streambuf) 
of tt(std::istream) objects, allowing line-editing and history manipulation.

The bf(ReadLineBuf) class uses Gnu's readline library to allow editing of
input lines. A tt(ReadLineBuf) can be used to construct a tt(std::istream)
allowing in-line editing of lines read from the terminal. All lines may be
preceded by a configurable prompt. 

bf(ReadLineBuf) offers editing capabilities while the user is entering
lines. Like Gnu's bf(readline)(3) function, the line editing commands are
by default similar to those of bf(emacs)(1), but can easily be reconfigured,
e.g. to offer bf(vi)(1)-like characteristics. 

History manipulation is provided as an option. The collected history may be
accessed for reading using an bf(FBB::ReadLineHistory) object. 

Specific information about the facilities offered by the Gnu software used by
bf(ReadLineBuf) is provided in the GNU Readline Library documentation
(tt(http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html)).

Gnu's tt(readline) function reads its information from the standard input
file. Programs using tt(ReadLineBuf) should normally not extract information
from tt(std::cin). However, as the standard input file has a file descriptor
(0), redirection should be possible (e.g., using tt(FBB::Redirector)).

    tt(std::streambuf)

manpagesection(CONSTRUCTORS)
    itemization(
    itb(ReadLineBuf(std::string const &prompt = ""))
        This constructor initializes a tt(ReadLineBuf) with an initial prompt,
using a history of at most tt(INT_MAX) lines.
    itb(ReadLineBuf(size_t historySize, std::string const &prompt = ""))
        This constructor initializes a tt(ReadLineBuf) with an initial prompt,
and an initial history of a predefined maximum size. Specifying a history size
0 results in no history being kept, any value equal to or exceeding the
predefined constant tt(INT_MAX) results in a history of at most tt(INT_MAX)
lines. 
    )
    The standard copy constructor is not available.

manpagesection(MEMBER FUNCTIONS)
     All members of bf(std::streambuf) are
available, as bf(FBB::ReadLineBuf) inherits from this class.
    itemization(
    itb(void setPrompt(std::string const &prompt = "")) 
        This member can be used to alter the prompt that is displayed in
front of the next line read from the terminal. When called without arguments
no prompt will be displayed. tt(setPrompt) can be called while input lines are
being received. The new prompt will be active after the current line has been
read from the terminal.
