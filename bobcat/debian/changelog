bobcat (1.6.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * minor repair in Pattern- and Selector manpages

    added MultiStrambuf, IOStreambuf, IOStream: see the manpages for details.

    redesigned Process: insertions insert to the child process, extractions
    extract from the child process. STDOUT and STDERR can or cannot be
    merged. See the man-page for details.

    redesigned Arg: same functionality as before, but allows for multiple
    specifications of options, also those having arguments. When multiple
    options having arguments are specified, each individual argument is
    retrievable. 

    added string::escape()
    
    `get...' accessors removed from all classes, (Arg, Fork and Pipe)
    Old names are kept for the time being.

bobcat (1.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * The general bobcat manpage did not have links to wrap1c and wrap2c. Now 
    Repaired. 

    The Log-class interface is modified. See the man -e bobcat log manpage for
    details. The main difference is that a static initialize() member is now
    used to define the static Log-object. Also, logs may be written to stdout
    using a simpler specification than before. The Log class also supports an
    open() member, allowing you to open a local Log object after its
    construction. 

    Added the class Milter, offering a C++ interface to the (sendmail)
    libmilter API. This class uses the `virtual constructor' Design Pattern to
    prevent the need for saving and accessing private connection based data
    using the libmilter api smfi_setpriv() and smfi_getpriv(). See `man -e
    bobcat milter' for details.

    Added the class Xpointer, setting and retrieving the X-windows pointer
    coordinates. 

    With the shared object library, functions from both libmilter and libX11
    must be available before a program can be fully linked. To prevent
    unnessary linking to these libraries, required dummy C functions were
    added to the bobcat library. When using libmilter and/or libX11, that
    these libraries should be mentioned to the linker before libbobcat.
