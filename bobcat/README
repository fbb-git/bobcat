This library contains C++ classes (and header files) I frequently use in my
programs. All its entities are defined in the namespace FBB.

To include the library, add `-l bobcat' to your link-command, to include a header
file for the class `Class' include 'bobcat/class' unless otherwise indicated.

To compile this library, use `icmake'. No support for `make' is offered.
If you don't want to use `icmake', 

    1. Compile all sources
    2. Put them in a library libbobcat.a
    3. Create a shared library from libbobcat.a
    4. Install the headers at /usr/include/bobcat
    5. Install the libraries (.a, .so* versions) at /usr/lib

and you're done.

Precompiled binaries are offered in the .deb archives. To compile programs
using the bobcat library you must install the bobcat-dev_*.deb package, to
have the shared library on your system only bobcat_*.deb must be installed. 

When installing the -dev version, html versions of the manual pages are found
in the directory /usr/share/doc/bobcat-dev/man/. Alternatively:

    man bobcat          - shows the main index 
    man -e bobcat class - shows the man-page for `class'
