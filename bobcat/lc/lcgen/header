// This header file was generated by the lcgen program which is distributed
// with the Bobcat source archive under the directory 'bobcat/lc/lcgen' The
// distributed Local Context header allows for the definition and declaration
// of a local context having at most 10 arguments. If you need more arguments
// (e.g. 15), then generate your own local context header file using the
// command:
//      lcgen 15 your-header
// and #include your-header rather than bobcat/lc in your sources.
