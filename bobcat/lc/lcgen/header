// This header file was generated by the bobcatlcgen program which is
// distributed with the Bobcat source archive under the directory
// 'bobcat/lc/lcgen'. The binary program itself is probably available as
// /usr/bin/bobcatlcgen. 
// The distributed Local Context header allows for the definition and
// declaration of a local context struct having at most 10 fields. If you need
// more fields (e.g., 15), then generate your own local context header file
// using the command:
//
//      bobcatlcgen 15 your-header
//
// and #include "your-header" rather than <bobcat/lc> in your sources.
