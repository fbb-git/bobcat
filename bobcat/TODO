To repair: 
    some User's memberfunctions erroneously report size_t rather than
    string returntypes. (done)

    ConfigFile's manpage sometimes uses Configfile rather than ConfigFile
    (done)

    Process: explain that system() does imply start() and provide illustration
    (as used in, e.g., the remailer)

    X2a:
        X2a may also need a toString() member. Incomplete manpage section:
       itbf(operator  std::ostream  &operator<<(std::ostream  &ostr, X2a const
       &x2a)) This conversion operator inserts the converted value in the  x2a
       parameter into the provided ostream.

added:
    ConfigFile:findKey(string key, size_t idx = 1): key is a pattern and by
        default its first pattern element is returned.
    
    Process::close(), manpage description: TO DO
    Process: add member to inspect the currently stored command text
