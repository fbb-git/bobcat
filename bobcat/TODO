To repair: 
    some User's memberfunctions erroneously report size_t rather than
    string returntypes. (done)

    ConfigFile's manpage sometimes uses Configfile rather than ConfigFile
    (done)

    Process: explain that system() does not imply start()

added:
    ConfigFile:findKey(string key, size_t idx = 1): key is a pattern and by
        default its first pattern element is returned.
