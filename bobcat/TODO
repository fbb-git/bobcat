Add missing functions to Stat

Add info to the stat manpage indicating what fields of the stat struct are
returned by the specific members (in particular: device related)

The Glob() constructor can throw an exception: must be repaired

The Arg class is off-by-one when detecting an unknown option. E.g.
    tmp/bin/xd --verbose -tm
    ArgData::ArgData(): unknown option: --verbose
or:
    tmp/bin/xd -tm
    ArgData::ArgData(): unknown option: tmp/bin/xd
