To repair: 

    X2a:
        X2a may also need a toString() member. Incomplete manpage section:
       itbf(operator  std::ostream  &operator<<(std::ostream  &ostr, X2a const
       &x2a)) This conversion operator inserts the converted value in the  x2a
       parameter into the provided ostream.

    Msg's open function should also set the opening mode
