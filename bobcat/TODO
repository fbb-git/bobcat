FnWrap contains a provisional implementation, but there is a flaw, causing
compilation errors with g++ >= 4.6. So FnWrap is temporarily (?) left in its
old state.

  * Re-implemented FnWrap: its size has been halved, FnWrap::unary and
    FnWrap::binary act identically and are now in fact superseded by the
    function  FBB::context().

  * Added README.fnwrap to the set of README files, explaining the FnWrap's 
    inner workings



Add getword(), setword(), and other common operators to BigInt
