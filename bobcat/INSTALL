To Install the bobcat library by hand instead of using the binary distribution
perform the following steps:

    1. Inspect the values of the variables in the file INSTALL.cf.  Modify
       these when necessary.  In particular note the definition of the
       COMPILER shell variable, which is set to Gnu's g++ compiler as used in
       Debian's `unstable' distribution. Removing the definition using the
       explicit version results in the definition of COMPILER as `g++', which
       should be your default g++ compiler.

    2. Run `./make/library' to compile the bobcat library

        Note: it's NOT `make library'

       ./make/library asks whether you want to compile the Milter and Xpointer
       classes. 

       To compile the Milter class you need the header libmilter/mfapi.h,
       which is (in Debian) part of the libmilter-dev package. 

       To compile Xpointer, you need X11/Xlib.h, which is (in Debian) part of
       the libx11-dev package.

       If you don't intend to write programs using these classes, it's ok not
       to include these classes into the library, since no other classes
       depend on these two (see README.class-setup). If you're sure that you
       want to compile these classes (so, the headers are available), then
       `./make library all' will compile the bobcat library with no questions
       asked.
    
    3. Run (probably as root) ./make/install to install

        Note: it's NOT `make install'

    Following the installation nothing in this directory tree is required
    for the proper functioning of the bobcat library, so consider removing it.


Make sure that the library is found by the loader. By default it is installed
in /usr/lib, which is in the loader's standard search path

By default the headers are stored under /usr/include. Since this is part of
the compiler's the standard include path the header files are included as,
e.g., #include <bobcat/errno>. No `bobcat' headers have extenstions.

By default the manual pages are stored under /usr/share/man/man3 and
/usr/share/man/man7, which are normally in the `man' program's set of visited
directories.
