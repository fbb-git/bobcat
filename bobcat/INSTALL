To Install the bobcat library by hand instead of using the binary distribution
or using icmake's build script perform the following steps:

    1. Inspect the values of the variables in the file INSTALL.cf
       Modify these when necessary.

    2. Run `./bootstrap' to compile and install the bobcat library and header
       files.
