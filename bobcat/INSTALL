To Install the bobcat library by hand instead of using the binary distribution
perform the following steps:

    1. Inspect the values of the variables in the file INSTALL.cf
       Modify these when necessary.

    2. Run `./make/library' to compile the bobcat library

        Note: it's not `make library'
    
    3. Run (probably as root) ./make/install to install

        Note: it's not `make install'

    Following the installation nothing in this directory tree is required
    for the proper functioning of the bobcat library, so consider removing it.


Make sure that the library is found by the loader. By default it is installed
in /usr/lib, which is in the loader's standard search path

By default the headers are stored under /usr/include. Since this is part of
the compiler's the standard include path the header files are included as,
e.g., #include <bobcat/errno>. No `bobcat' headers have extenstions.

By default the manual pages are stored under /usr/share/man/man3 and
/usr/share/man/man7, which are normally in the `man' program's set of visited directories.
