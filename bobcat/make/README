The scripts in these directory are support-script for program maintenance.

Normally, only the following scripts should be called from this directory's
parent directory:

    clean   - as ./make/clean   to clean up remnants of previous compilation
                                etc. tasks When BISONCPP=minimal is set, only 
                                a minimal cleanup is performed

    library  - constructs    tmp/lib libraries and tmp/bobcat/ header files
                             the script offers optional inclusion of milter,
                             including the Milter class into bobcat and
                             optional inclusion of xpointer, inclusing the
                             Xpointer class into bobcat. 
                             Calling `make/library all' will not present the
                             options, but will include all classes. This is
                             also used in the debian/rules file.

    install  - as ./make/install to install the software in the locations
                                indicated by the INSTALL.cf file (found in 
                                this directory's parent directory)

Support scripts called by the `program' script are:

    man         - constructs the man-page in tmp/man and tmp/manhtml

    manual      - constructs the manual in tmp/manual using yodl.

    parameters  - defines the names of the library, the program source, etc.

    special     - performs special tasks: creates release.yo and parser/SKEL

    scanner     - constructs scanner/yylex.cc from scanner/lexer using flex
