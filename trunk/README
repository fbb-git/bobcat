    This is the top-level directory of the bobcat library source tree.

    The directory `sourceforge' probably not useful for anybody but me, but
since it serves an important role for me in uploading the Bobcat docs to
sourceforge, they belong to this project.

    To create a source archive, run

        ./sourcetar

    This will create an archive named like bobcat_1.10.2.tar.gz. 

    To create an `upstream debian archive' provide sourcetar with an (any)
    argument. E.g.,

        ./sourcetar x 

    This will create an archive named like bobcat_1.10.2.orig.tar.gz

    The numbers will of course follow bobcat's version.

    To create the library from its sources, either descend into the bobcat
    directory, or unpack a created archive, cd into its top-level directory 
    and follow the instructions provided in the INSTALL file found there.
