The directories below this one contain various programs illustrating the
CLientSocket and ServerSocket classes. 

To compile the programs, descend into the directories and run the `build'
script. Icmake must be available to run `build'. 

The following programs are available:

    - server    - simple server program, serving one client at the time.

                  Start the server as

                        server <portnr>

                  where <portnr> is the port at which the server will listen
                  for incoming connections. E.g.,

                        server 12345

                  The communication protocol is extremely simple: the server
                  expects a single line from the client, echoes the line and
                  terminates the connection. If the line holds a single `q'
                  the server itself will terminate.

    - client    - simple client program, matching the abovementioned server.

                  Start the client as

                        client <host> <portnr>

                  where <host> is the name of the computer running the server,
                  and <portnr> is the port at which the server will listen
                  for incoming connections. E.g.,

                        client localhost 12345

    - forkserver - simple server program, serving multiple clients, each
                  running as its own independent process. It implements the
                  same protocol as `server', mentioned above.

                  Start the server as

                        forkserver <portnr>

                  where <portnr> is the port at which the server will listen
                  for incoming connections. E.g.,

                        forkserver 12345
            
                  Use the client defined in the `client' subdirectory.

    - forkserver2 - server program, serving multiple clients, each
                  running as its own independent process. It implements a more
                  complex protocol than `forkserver'

                  Start the server as

                        forkserver2 <portnr>

                  where <portnr> is the port at which the server will listen
                  for incoming connections. E.g.,

                        forkserver2 12345
            
                  The protocol allows for 2-way communication between
                  client(s) and server. The server will start an independent
                  process for each new client, and these processes will echo
                  lines received from clients back to the clients. If a client
                  sends a line holding a single `q', the server process
                  terminates. 

                  Use the `client2' program (see below) with this server.

    - client2   - client program, matching the abovementioned server.

                  Start the client as

                        client2 <host> <portnr>

                  where <host> is the name of the computer running the server,
                  and <portnr> is the port at which the server will listen
                  for incoming connections. E.g.,

                        client2 localhost 12345
