To Install the bobcat library by hand instead of using the binary distribution
perform the following steps:

    0. The previously used scripts below make/ are obsolete and were removed
        from this and future distributions. Icmake should be used instead, for
        which a top-level script (build) and support scripts in the ./icmake/
        directory are available. Icmake is available on a great many
        architectures. See the file INSTALL (and INSTALL.im, replacing the
        previously used INSTALL.cf) for further details.

    1. Inspect the values of the variables in the file INSTALL.im Modify these
       when necessary.

    2. Run 
            build libraries

        to compile the bobcat libraries. 
        Optionally add the argument 'strip' if you want the libraries to be
        stripped. Unless you need the symbolic information in the compiled
        object modules, it is probably a good idea to provide this
        argument. So in that case issue:

            build libraries strip 

        If you want to add the Milter and Xpointer classes, issue

            build libraries all
        or
            build libraries all strip

        If `all' is omitted, you will be asked interactively which of the two
        classes (if any) should be added to the libraries.

       To compile the Milter class you need the header libmilter/mfapi.h,
       which is (in Debian) part of the libmilter-dev package. 

       To compile Xpointer, you need X11/Xlib.h, which is (in Debian) part of
       the libx11-dev package.

       If you don't intend to write programs using these classes, it's ok not
       to include these classes into the library, since no other classes
       depend on these two (see README.class-setup).
    
    3. Run (probably as root) 
            ./build install
       to install. Optionally add two additional argument as a base
        directories below which respectively the run time (shared) library
        documentation and the development files plus static library 
        documentation will be installed.


    Following the installation nothing in this directory tree is required
    for the proper functioning of the bobcat library, so consider removing it.


Make sure that the library is found by the loader. By default it is installed
in /usr/lib, which is in the loader's standard search path

By default the headers are stored under /usr/include. Since this is part of
the compiler's the standard include path the header files are included as,
e.g., #include <bobcat/errno>. No `bobcat' headers have extenstions.

By default the manual pages are stored under /usr/share/man/man3 and
/usr/share/man/man7, which are normally in the `man' program's set of visited
directories.
