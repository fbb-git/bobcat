The following diagram shows the class dependencies. Classes listed on the same
line have no mutual dependencies. Classes listed on lines starting with the
digit 0 are not depenent on other bobcat classes. Then, diagrams showing
dependencies of other classes. Dependencies should be read upwards, e.g.,
String depends on A2x, Hostname depends on Hostent and Exception.

Dependencies refer to the construction of the class members as well as the use
of the class headers. So, when compiling the class Msg the class Exception
must be available (if not compile-time then most likely run-time). The
dependencies are not necessarily related to inheritance.

The file CLASSES lists all classes, in something resembling the order of
addition of the classes to the Bobcat library. The classes `Milter' and
`Xpointer' are optionally compiled, and are therefore not listed in the
CLASSES file.

The label IUO does not refer to a class but to functions defined in the FBB
namespace for internal use only. They are declared in the bobcat/iuo header.

Entries below, tagged with `(cont)' were mentioned earlier in the next
hierarchy. Entries tagged with (Obs) are obsolete and should no longer be
used.
